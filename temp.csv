"According to Business Insider, cryptocurrency exchanges are charging between $50,000 and $1 million to list initial coin offerings. The information is based on a survey of around half a dozen market participants. Notably, it would cost less than $1 million to list on most stock exchanges.

Receiving venture capital is not easy. It is also a time consuming process. Therefore, for businesses, ICO offers an easy way to raise capital for projects. For investors, tokens offer an exciting opportunity to make money in a short period of time. However, in order to reach investors, the companies issuing tokens have to list in one or more cryptocurrency exchanges. This gives a strong bargaining power to cryptocurrency exchanges.

Oliver Bussmann, former CIO of UBS, running his own Swiss fintech advisory firm, said

The rate for listing a token varies greatly, depending on the trading volume of the exchanges. While the 24-hour trading volume of Binance is $1.70 billion, Bitstamp has a daily trading volume of $334 million. Therefore, cryptocurrency exchanges which offer access to larger liquidity charges higher listing fees. Developers are also willing to shell out the listing fees as the success of a project is also dependent (to a certain extent) on the traded price of the token.

When Business Insider got in touch with Kraken regarding the fees charged, the spokesperson of the exchange stated “We do not release this kind of information to the public.”

However, Korean exchange Huobi allows listing without any charges, but the coins are selected based on voting. Coinbase, which owns the GDAX exchange stated that its platform does not support ICO tokens.

Bittrex has published a guidance regarding token listing. It says “Bittrex does not currently charge a fee for listing a token on our Exchange. We believe in promoting the blockchain industry, and we have spent, and will continue to invest, significant resources to review tokens for listing on our Exchange.”

Bittrex spokesperson also clarified to Business Insider that the company has a two-step review process that involves a quality review and an internal compliance review.

However, regulators across the globe are quickly sprung into action. Recently, the US SEC has demanded cryptocurrency exchanges to register with them. Bussman believes that such moves will bring down fees and improve transparency in the market.

“Basically, there are a lot of people who want their coins listed. The exchanges are where the liquidity is — it’s where the money is — so that’s where the power is just at the moment. There’s always going to be a premium for listing on good exchanges but I think in the end it will get more rational when things become more rational. I think it will calm down a bit.”"

"A software package that until late today was offered for download in the Mac App Store has been discovered to mine cryptocurrency by default. But in a strange twist, the company behind the app actually disclosed the fact to users upfront.

The app, called Calendar 2, is pitched as a replacement to the default macOS calendar app, with additional scheduling features, themes and social media integration. That may sound like an appealing pitch, but the developers behind the app added code to mine for the Monero cryptocurrency in the last few days.

The code ran in exchange for letting users access more premium features. Users can opt out of using the cryptominer and access the premium features by paying for them instead, an interesting twist in terms of freemium software offerings. The issue is that users are opted in by default.

However, criticism of inserting miner code by default may have persuaded the developer, Qbix, to pull the application for now. As of late today, it was no longer available in the Mac app store. Qbix founder Gregory Magarshak told Ars Technica that he will remove the miner from future versions of the software.

“On the one hand, using the user’s CPU for cryptomining has become extremely unpopular,” Thomas Reed, director of Mac & Mobile at the antimalware software firm Malwarebytes told Ars Technica. “The fact that this is the default is something I don’t like. I would want to see a legit app informing the user in advance or making it an option that can be turned on but is off by default.”

But Reed noted that the developers were completely upfront about what’s going on, and that ultimately it should be a matter of user choice. “Some people might be perfectly willing to let an app like this mine cryptocurrency so that they can use it for free,” Reed added.

The moral angle aside, it turns out that there were bugs in the code used causing the mining code to consume more resources than originally intended. The app “ate 200% CPU until I found it and killed it. I didn’t expect a miner infection from an App Store vendor. Wow,” one user wrote on Twitter.

According to the website for the app, it has been download by 757,627 users at the time of writing, but it’s not clear from reports whether the later version with the cryptomining code was pushed out as an update to existing users or was only bundled with new downloads. Either way, potentially hundreds of thousands of people could potentially be running the cryptomining code.

"Investing in cryptocurrencies is complicated. Four new trusts make it easier, says crypto investor Michael Sonnenshein.

""Digital currencies are not like stocks and bonds and all the other things that you buy,"" Sonnenshein, managing director at Grayscale Investments, a digital currency investment firm, said Monday on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" ""There's certain technological prowess that people need to have in order to handle them, store them securely, et cetera.""

Recognizing that investors want exposure to digital currencies, Grayscale launched four new crypto funds: Bitcoin Cash Investment Trust, Ethereum Investment Trust, Litecoin Investment Trust and XRP Investment Trust.

Grayscale is the creator of the popular Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a way to invest in and trade the price moves of bitcoin without directly investing in the digital currency.

The new trusts, Sonnenshein said, are ""something that people can really wrap their heads around.""

So far, in the week since the products were introduced, the demand has been ""fantastic,"" said Sonnenshein, whose company has approximately $2.1 billion in assets under management across eight different products.

""There's a lot of investors who want to be able to place targeted exposure in a fund,"" he said.

 ""And, there are also investors who want that more-diversified exposure, like the digital large-cap fund offers.""

""We're continuing to break records all the time,"" Sonnenshein said.

He said each fund operates as a trust on a rules-based methodology, where tokens are evaluated each quarter to see if they have fallen into the 70 percent target of the overall market cap in digital currencies.

""Of course there are other qualifiers and disqualifiers: There's got to be a liquid market. We have to have a custodial solution that we feel really is secure and robust and allows us to continue to operationally support the product,"" Sonnenshein said.

Each fund has a one-year holding period before it can be resold without restrictions. Only U.S. qualified accredited investors can put money into funds. Sonnenshein said Grayscale plans to roll out more new products later this year."

"The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

By early February, Bitcoin had plunged about 68 percent from its lifetime highs in mid-December. This fall affected Bitcoin’s popularity, as measured by the number of people searching for it on Google. In the first half of March, Google Trends shows that Bitcoin searches have fallen to their lowest levels since October of last year.

It isn’t necessarily a bad thing for the leading cryptocurrency. This shows that the euphoric phase has ended and some investors have fled the market. Now, only the most interested participants who have a greater conviction in the cryptocurrencies remain.

When prices don’t sustain below support levels on negative news, it is a sign that the bears are losing their grip. The early stages of a bull phase always cause worries. As and when prices recover, the ‘speculators’ will jump right back in.

Let’s see if we find any buy setups for the top coins.

The bears were unable to take advantage of the breakdown below $9,500 levels on Bitcoin on March 10. Prices quickly recovered on the next day, March 11, which shows strong buying support at lower levels.

Currently, the  BTC/USD pair is trading at a critical level.

The level between $10,000 to $10,300 has resistances from the moving averages and the resistance line of the descending channel. Once the price breaks out and sustains above $10,300 for four hours, it can be purchased with a stop loss of $8,700.

The first target objective is a rally to $12,150 from where the cryptocurrency has returned on three previous occasions. If prices break out of this resistance, Bitcoin will start a new uptrend.

$654.02 has proven to be strong support on Ethereum. For the past three days, prices are trading inside a tight range of $745 to $654.

If the bulls break out of this tight range, the ETH/USD pair might rally to the $800 levels where it will face resistance from the 20-day EMA and the resistance line of the descending channel.

Once these two resistances are crossed, the next resistance will be at $900 from 50-day SMA. The cryptocurrency doesn’t offer a good risk to reward ratio to the swing traders, however, the intraday traders can buy once prices break out of the resistances for a quick profit.

In case of a breakdown of the range, a fall to $565 is likely.

Bitcoin Cash has held the $1,000 levels for the past three days. Yesterday, March 11, prices broke out of the $1,150 overhead resistance, but the bulls have failed to build on this move.

Right now, the BCH/USD pair is facing resistance at the downtrend line. Just above lies the 20-day EMA. The bears will defend the $1,150 to $1,200 zone. Once above it, we might see a move to $1,355, which is major resistance.

On the other hand, if the $1,000 level breaks down, the cryptocurrency can slide to $854.

Our buy call on Ripple did not trigger because it has held above the $0.73 levels for the past three days.

We expect the XRP/USD pair to remain range bound for a few days. If the sentiment in the crypto industry improves, a rally to the upper end of the range at $1.22 is possible. Traders can buy on a breakout of $0.85 and keep a stop loss of $0.72. This is a risky trade, hence, please trade with only 50 percent of your usual position size.

If the bears break below $0.73, Ripple can fall to $0.695 and then to $0.5627.

The price action in Stellar has been sluggish. The bears have not been able to take advantage of the breakdown below $0.32 levels. While we have been expecting a drop to $0.22 levels, the bulls have successfully defended the $0.25 levels.

Though the bulls are buying at the lows, they have not been able to push prices above $0.32.

We shall suggest a long trade on the XLM/USD pair once prices sustain above $0.32 levels for a couple of days.

Litecoin is also trading in a tight range for the past four days. As the price has reached the apex of the descending triangle pattern, the bearish setup is not valid anymore.

If the bulls break out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, we can expect the LTC/USD pair to start moving towards $250 levels. Therefore, we recommend buying Litecoin on a close (UTC) above $200. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $165.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the present levels and breaks below $180 once again, a decline to $160 can be expected.

Cardano continues to trade in a small range as forecast in the previous analysis. As both the bulls and the bears are in a state of equilibrium, there is no trade setup.

One of the parties will exert their dominance within the next few days with a large range move. We should wait for it and then recommend a position.

At the moment, any up move is likely to face resistance at 0.0000246. Above this, the next resistance will be from the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, which are at about the same level of 0.0000275. Once the ADA/BTC pair breaks out of this, it might start a new trend. Until then, we shall remain on the sidelines.

On the downside, the next support is at 0.00001690.

NEO is looking weak as the bulls have not been able to push prices above $93.5 level in the past four days. This shows lack of buying.

Now, if the NEO/USD pair breaks down of the $80 levels, it will complete the descending triangle pattern.

Though the pattern targets are way lower, we need to take it one step at a time. The immediate support is the February 06 lows of $63.62.

We will attempt a long trade if the cryptocurrency sustains above the $100 levels for a couple of days.

For the past four days, EOS is struggling to hold the support level. Failure of the bulls to bounce off strong support indicates weakness.

The bears will now try to break below the supports and push prices towards the $3.65 levels.

A breakdown will invalidate our view of a range formation in the EOS/USD pair.

"Running a major cryptocurrency exchange is a lucrative business. Coinbase is reported to have made over $1 billion last year, and Binance is on course to pull in $850 million annually. While the bulk of these profits come from trading fees, they’re not the only revenue stream: exchanges are also pocketing millions from the fees ICOs and altcoin developers must pay to have their token listed.

Also read: ‘Cryptomatoes’ Using Excess Mining Heat to Grow Produce

Most cryptocurrency exchanges don’t publicly advertise their listing fees, though these are known to run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the millions in some cases. The bigger the exchange, the higher the price that must be paid for tapping into its liquidity pool and army of existing users. Business Insider reports on ICO founders who claim to have been asked for between $50,000 and $1 million for having their token listed. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao questioned these numbers, and also defended listing fees, tweeting “most investment banks charge 7% for just underwriting an IPO deal”, by way of comparison.

It’s not just centralized exchanges that can hold ICOs hostage with hefty listing fees: the same is true of major cryptocurrency mobile wallets too. One altcoin developer told news.Bitcoin.com that they were quoted a fee of $3.5 million for being integrated with a popular mobile wallet. They declined. Exchanges such as Bittrex and Bitfinex assert that they do not charge a listing fee, though some people question this. With exchanges requiring ICOs to sign highly restrictive NDAs before token listing can even be discussed, firm figures are hard to come by.

It is rumored to cost up to $1 million for a listing on Binance, with the only exception being the community coin of the month that’s voted in by platform users. (One source has placed Binance’s listing fee at closer to $350,000, but expresses uncertainty over whether this is a one-off or annual fee.) For many altcoins and ICOs, the cost of a ticket to the high liquidity league is simply too much, limiting these projects to smaller exchanges such as Gate.io and Tradesatoshi. Viacoin developer Romano wouldn’t confirm how much he paid to get VIA on Binance, but conceded that had it not been for a successful crypto trading career, he would have been unable to afford it.

For all their associations with decentralization, cryptocurrencies are still heavily reliant on centralized platforms. Securing support from big exchanges and major hardware and software wallets isn’t essential, but without such adoption, altcoins risk being marginalized and inaccessible to the masses. It’s one of many paradoxes within the crypto space: for crypto to go mainstream, it needs to be on mainstream platforms. Exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are the Facebooks of the cryptoverse; virtual monopolies with the power to make or break projects.

"Cryptocurrency operations are becoming as prevalent as the farms in Eastern Washington, thanks to the region’s cheap energy costs.

“Let’s say I’m going to send you some money,” Ron explained to Don. “You say, ‘Hey Ron, I need $1 million in bitcoin.’ So I go to my computer and I send you $1 million. There are computers verifying this transaction all around the world — one of them is in Wenatchee. They get this transaction and they start solving an algorithm. It’s a really tough math problem and one computer in the world will come up with a solution first. It proves that the transaction was above board, verifying I have $1 million in bitcoin, and verifying your address. They are rewarded with a tiny fraction of a bitcoin for doing the work.”

RELATED: Virtual money has a few pitfalls to worry about

That computing process eats up a lot of electricity. And cryptocurrency miners like to use a lot of computers to do the job — thousands. Thanks to nearby hydroelectric dams, Politico reports, bitcoin miners have targeted Eastern Washington to set up cryptocurrency operations — particularly in Chelan, Douglas, and Grant counties. Power in the region is the cheapest in the nation — 1/4 of Seattle’s energy rates and about 1/5 of the national average.

Bitcoin miners have added all these factors together over the past few years. They have bought up any old building they can find in Eastern Washington — old fruit warehouses, closed down car washes, etc. They put computer servers inside and start mining. Others are building new structures for mining operations.

Today, new miners are coming to the region to build operations with tens of thousands of servers. Servers use up to 30 megawatts (enough to power 13,000 homes, Politico notes). Out-of-state investors from Wall Street, Asia, and Europe are supporting the mining operations.

Introduction of the new industry leads some to wonder about the vitality of the area. How will these high-tech mining operations affect the local communities?

“That’s what’s happening in Eastern Washington right now,” Ron said. “Power over there is cheap. Land is relatively cheap. So the big guys, the bitcoin miners are coming in and buying up old warehouses or putting in thousands and thousands of bitcoin mining processors.”

“It could either be ground zero of the future of money,” he said. “Or it could decimate those Eastern Washington towns.”"

"More Illinois universities are starting to provide blockchain and digital currency education. Public interest in the revolutionary payment methods and their underlying technology continues to grow, even as the prices of many crypto assets have come down considerably in 2018.

According to the Chicago Tribune, digital currency and related topics have become an important part of class discussions on finance and money. Previously, they had comprised a very small section of the syllabus.

Lamont Black, an assistant professor of both graduate and undergraduate classes, told the publication about the change in lesson plans. The DePaul lecturer stated that he had been teaching students about the subject as part of the final “fun day” of class at the end of the semester. Now, he claims:

Other Illinois universities are also following suit. Some are adding entire modules devoted to the subject whilst others are changing existing lesson plans to include more coverage of digital currency. Sarit Markovich, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellog School of Management, explained about her institution’s decision to include a course on blockchain and cryptocurrency:

“It’s not so much about being ahead; it’s making sure that you’re not going to be behind.”

She started discussing the subject around five years ago. However, the students then were not that interested in the topic. She went on to mention that last year, that changed. Suddenly, her students were asking about fintech, blockchain, and digital currencies.

Markovich recently got approval to create a course entirely devoted to the study of cryptocurrency. She’s hoping to offer it to students in the Masters of Business Administration program next year.

The Illinois Institute of Technology is also poised to offer their own blockchain class this summer. Meanwhile, the University of Illinois is planning a discussion panel on Bitcoin later this month. It will be led by professor Gib Basset, the head of the finance department. The discussion will form part of the Chicago Exchanges MBA program.

The professor told the Chicago Tribune that it was pressure from the students that caused him to consider including the topic for the first time:

“They want to hear about Bitcoin. Their parents have told them it’s a tulip bubble… It’s crazy, it’s ridiculous, and their friends who invested three years ago are millionaires. … There’s clearly a generational component to this.”

It’s not just Illinois institutions that are beginning to offer more cryptocurrency courses, however. It seems to be a growing trend in universities around the world. Meanwhile, other centres of education are trying to get even younger students familiar with the topic. Union Catholic High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, have announced plans to introduce cryptocurrency classes, and a high school in Australia have a cryptocurrency education night for parents, teachers, and students."

"When most people first learn about Metronome — a new cryptocurrency developed by Bitcoin pioneer Jeff Garzik — their attention is usually first captured by its ability transcend blockchains. However, equally as important is Metronome’s approach to blockchain governance — a topic to which many cryptocurrency users devote too little attention.

Blockchain governance, as defined by Metronome’s developers, is the “way(s) in which a community that built and manages the project defines that community’s explicit and customary norms.”

In most early cryptocurrency projects, developers prioritized engineering over governance, which made sense since they were largely experimenting with a new technology. However, Bloq believes that, over a multi-decade or century time-frame, governance is equally — if not more — important to a cryptocurrency’s durability.

To date, most cryptocurrencies have been governed either by a “benevolent dictator for life” or a highly-influential group of core developers to whose judgment the community almost always defers.

Jeff Garzik, an early Bitcoin developer who now serves as CEO of blockchain technology firm Bloq, told Strategic Coin that these types of governance structures create systemic risk.

Development teams can disagree about how best to approach a particular problem — scaling the network to accommodate more users, for instance — leading to fractures within the community and uncertainty about the project’s future.

A “benevolent dictator,” on the other hand, may abandon a project unexpectedly, dealing a mortal blow to its future — and the value of investors’ assets.

Having seen the detrimental effects of these governance structures appear and reappear throughout cryptocurrency’s nearly decade-long history, Bloq consciously designed Metronome so that it would be self-governing — and have as few developer touch-points as possible.

Metronome — which rides on top of other blockchains rather than existing in its own isolated network — is managed by a series of immutable smart contracts that no one can alter — not even Bloq.

Because Metronome does not have its own blockchain, there is no need for ongoing protocol development; this limits the potential for infighting over specific development proposals — the types of conflicts that have caused contentious divorces in both the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities.

The loser in these messy breakups is always the user, which Bloq believes is one reason institutional investors have been hesitant to allocate meaningful portions of their assets into cryptocurrencies.

Metronome, however, runs concurrently on multiple blockchains, and users can easily move their MTN tokens between chains. This ensures that users’ coins are never trapped on a dying network — or one beset with other systemic risks such as miner centralization and developer drama.

If problems do infect an underlying blockchain, users do not need to panic, sell their tokens at a loss, or risk that their assets will become worthless. Instead, they can easily port their MTN to another network by interacting with the system’s smart contracts.

This places users — not developers or miners — in the driver’s seat, and it gives institutions with decade- and century-long time horizons the assurance they need that Metronome will, as its name promises, remain stable over the long-term.

“The blockchain is our railroad, and Metronome is your boxcar. And if there’s a problem with that railroad, then you can switch tracks,” Garzik concluded. “You should have the freedom to choose where your coins go.”"

According to CryptoCompare, “Synergy is a peer-to-peer decentralized cryptocurrency that uses a dual-algorithm system to mine blocks. For the first 10 days, which contains the full PoW (proof of work) period, Synergy uses the X11 algorithm. Because X11 is unnecessarily inefficient after PoW, Synergy switches to SHA256d for the PoS period (proof of stake). SHA256d is easier on CPUs during syncronization and bootstrap because it requires only two hashes to verify a block whereas X11 requires 11 hashes. The early part of the Synergy PoS period makes use of Turbo Stake, which awards Synergy holders greater interest for every stake. The multiplier is directly used in the reward calculation by multiplying it with the base Synergy interest rate of 10% per year. Holders build the Turbo Stake multiplier over two days by staking consistently. After that, the multiplier will level out and the holder will stake with a consistent rate that depends on how much stake competes with his. The Turbo Stake period lasts 30 days from the time of launch.  “

"Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc., reeling from government reprimands over lax standards after $530 million dollar theft of digital money, said it would from Monday start repaying customers affected by the heist.

"While there are a number of geopolitical and macroeconomic issues facing investors in the modern age, these individuals must also deal with a financial marketplace that is constantly changing. This is particularly true in the current climate, where technological advancement continues at a frightening pace and creates a diverse range of assets for individuals to invest in.

In this post, we’ll consider some of these assets (and markets) in further detail and ask why they’re so investible in 2018.

Let’s start with battery technology, which has seen exponential growth during the last 18 months. More specifically, it has benefited from more sustained demand and higher price points, with metals such as lithium and Cobalt taking center stage.

Lithium remains the leading battery metal, as it’s projected to achieve sustained growth over the course of the next six years. In fact, forecasts suggest that gross profit margins will remain in excess of $5,000 per ton for years, creating tremendous opportunities for businesses and investors alike.

Much of this has to do with the burgeoning electric car industry, which is set to achieve prolific growth during the next decade. Remember, the sales of electric vehicles recently exceeded 2 million worldwide, and this number will increase further as governments begin to gradually outlaw petrol and diesel cars.

Last year finally saw virtual reality (VR) enter the consumer mainstream, with this technology being applied successfully in the gaming and entertainment markets.

Despite this, it’s augmented reality (AR) technology that is expected to grow at a faster rate in the near-term, as it is more accessible and capable of introducing virtual elements into a corporeal world. Apple and Google are also headlining the brands hoping to fully embrace this technology, with Samsung also incorporating this into their premium Galaxy S range.

With these points in mind, it may be wise to invest in AR and related stocks before their associated values spiral. By 2023, it’s estimated that the AR market will be worth $61 billion, and arguably more advanced than the VR alternative.

We close with cryptocurrency and the unique technology that underpins it. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin (and more recently Ripple) have taken the market by storm in recent times, with the former having seen its value increase from $900 to a staggering $20,000 during 2017 alone.

So, while cryptocurrencies may remain volatile, they continue to benefit from technological advancement, increased regulatory measures and the development of brand new applications. This makes them viable investments in the near and longer-term, so long as you approach the market with knowledge and understanding.

Look out for Ethereum too, which is expected to see its market cap increase considerably in 2018 and emerge as a rival to Bitcoin and Ripple. This currency also has a wide range of applications in the online gaming sector, as it is behind the drive to create the world’s first, zero house edge casino.

In 2016 alone Lisk (LSK) raised more than $5 million in a month, Digix (DGD) raised over $5 million in just 14 hours, First Blood (1S?) raised over $5 million in less than five minutes back in September. “Each of these platforms is very much in its early stages.”

Between the numerous opportunities, such as “a worldwide potential investor pool to limited accreditation standards to multiple global exchanges providing 24/7 trading with deep order books and clients hungry for new assets,” and the “speed and ease of closing around has never been so efficient.”

This trend is only continuing to pick up steam."
"If one thing is for certain in the cryptocurrency space, more cybersecurity is needed in the sector and Hilltop Cybersecurity (CSE:CYBX) is putting forth its efforts in doing just that.

On March 5, the company revealed that it has developed a new cryptocurrency wallet for coins and private keys that are protected by biometric securities. According to the release, the device uses Hilltop’s biometric cryptocurrency security technology that protects and stores coins and private keys in “cold-storage.”

The company had previously announced that it filed its patent application for the biometric security solution back in December. According to that release, the purpose of the device is to protect against cybersecurity attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms, exampling missing passwords and theft as the some of the biggest culprits tainting the cryptocurrency industry.

“As cryptocurrencies continue to grow, so does the intensity of criminal activity,” Corby Marshall, CEO of Hilltop Cybersecurity said in the March release. “The industry has to embrace security if it is to thrive.” Back in December, Marshall said that as many as 3.79 million bitcoins are estimated to be gone forever, which is approximately 23 percent of all circulating bitcoins.

In an interview with the Investing News Network (INN), Marshall said if someone can’t use a digital currency in a mainstream transaction, then it will only ever be a novelty.

“Whether you view [cryptocurrencies] as fiat currencies or not, I believe if [they are] going to go mainstream in business transactions … you have to make them safe,” he said.

Marshall said the company’s focus is on small-to-medium businesses and providing those companies with software and services that protect their enterprises and activities within those enterprises. In terms of Hilltop’s cryptocurrency wallet, Marshall said the company isn’t focused on the consumer market, and will instead cater to Hilltop’s  small business audience. But, in the event the product catches consumer attention, Marshall said Hilltop may license it to a different company to sell.

“I think consumers are going to be interested in [the product] because one of the ways we’ve architected it is that it has cold keys and cold coin storage,” he said. “You don’t story anything on the device that’s of value.” Marshall continued, stating that the device has a “full factor” security and it has the notion of a GPS location, meaning the location on the device has to match up with where the user is. If the device and the user’s location don’t match up, then the device won’t work.

While the biometric-security cryptocurrency wallet was announced last week, Marshall said it will be a few months until the device completes its beta stage before being sold to businesses. From there, it will be determined as to whether or not it will be sold to a consumer audience.

Since the announcement, shares of Hilltop Cybersecurity have dipped by 22.86 percent to close at $0.54 on Tuesday (March 13).

"Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, announced that it is officially developing a public Blockchain to create a new decentralized exchange, according a statement on March 13.

Binance’s vision that “centralized and decentralized exchanges will co-exist in the near future, complementing each other” inspired them to develop the Binance Chain, which  will be used for the transfer and trading of Blockchain assets. The move will also push the cryptocurrency exchange toward transforming from a company into a community.

“We believe that continuously supporting high-quality blockchain projects is the best way to develop this industry. We will continue to improve this part, as we committed in our whitepaper,” the cryptocurrency said.

The new Blockchain will also host Binance Coin (BNB), which will become a native coin on its own Blockchain mainnet.

A decentralized exchange differs from a centralized exchange in that it does not rely on  a third party service to hold the customer’s funds. Users transact with other users without the need for a central server, and there is no central authority that possesses order books or custody.

While decentralized exchanges provide more anonymity and are lauded as being more difficult to hack, they can be less intuitive for beginning traders and lack some of the features and functionality of centralized exchanges.

Decentralized exchanges are not new as platforms like Waves DEX, BitShares, NXT, CounterParty have been around for some time.

Binance’s statement regarding decentralization was released a day after announcing a $250,000 equivalent bounty to anyone who could provide information that leads to the legal arrest of the hackers responsible for the hacking attempt on March 7."

Hexcoin is built on Gaze Coin, a monetisation platform that allows for VR and AR content to be monetised based upon what the user spends time looking at. By using eye-tracking technology to measure how long users spend looking at or interacting with objects in the virtual world, this information can be converted into a monetary value.

Hexagonia is planned to be a shared VR/AR world driven by user attention and interaction, merged with cryptocurrency in order to provide a space for fans of Don Diablo’s work and grow the audience in new directions.

“As a creator of electronic music, I’ve always been engaged in technology and how it can connect my art to the outside world,” Don Diablo said. “With HEXCOIN and HEXAGONIA, I see a future where the line between fan, artist and technology blurs, and creativity is unleashed in powerful, measurable ways. I’m extremely excited to welcome Hexagonians and future fans to the next level of technology in music.”

“We are thrilled to back Don’s vision for HXG and HEXAGONIA,” said Jon Peters, CEO and founder of Gaze Coin. “We will provide him with the templates he needs to create the world’s first hyper-reality entertainment channel. Don is a visionary and the first entertainment mega-brand to implement this.”

"Cryptocurrencies are heading back to Capitol Hill on Wednesday.

On March 14, a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing entitled ""Examining Cryptocurrencies and ICO Markets."" The hearing marks the first time a group within Congress will specifically tackle the question of initial coin offerings (ICOs), an area that is firmly in the cross-hairs of agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as regulators around the world.

Statements from some of the members of the Capital Markets, Securities and Investment Subcommittee suggest that the hearing will have a largely educational bent. Speaking to CoinDesk last week, U.S. Representative Tom Emmer indicated that some of those attending are there to learn more about cryptocurrencies and token sales.

""I think this is going to be more elementary,"" he said during an interview on the sidelines of last week's DC Blockchain Summit in Washington, D.C. ""I don't think they understand the depth or breadth of this thing - yet.""

Other comments speak to the ""appetite"" for discussion that Emmer highlighted. In a statement to CoinDesk, Rep. Randy Hultgren expressed a desire to talk about investor protections as they relate to ICOs.

""I look forward to discussing how cryptocurrencies can open up new opportunities in our financial markets. Specifically, I'm interested in discussing how to balance access to credit and investor protection as it relates to so-called initial coin offerings,"" he said.

A previously published list of witnesses certainly reinforces the informational nature of the hearing. Set to appear are Dr. Chris Brummer, a law professor from Georgetown University; Mike Lempres, Coinbase's chief legal and risk officer; Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director for the non-profit advocacy group Coin Center; and Robert Rosenblum, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati.

The degree of legal expertise tapped for the panel suggests that the discussion is likely to revolve around regulatory topics, especially on the question of classifying some tokens as securities.

The hearing represents the latest significant gathering of U.S. lawmakers around the topic of cryptocurrencies, coming over a month after the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee heard from the leaders of both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (SEC) in early February.

That event notably saw both the SEC's Jay Clayton and the CFTC's J. Christopher Giancarlo suggest that their respective agencies may one day come to Congress in an effort to see their jurisdictions extended to cover more of the cryptocurrency market.

That said, both agency chiefs indicated that they want to provide an accommodative environment for the tech - but not at the expense of investor protection and enforcement against potential scams.

""We owe it to this new generation to respect their enthusiasm for virtual currencies, with a thoughtful and balanced response, and not a dismissive one,"" Giancarlo remarked at the time.

Congress also has several bills related to cryptocurrencies, and while the long-term success of those measures isn't certain in a politically-charged environment, Wednesday's discussion may ultimately come into play as lawmakers look at proposals to beef up federal-level oversight of exchanges and study the link between cryptocurrencies and terrorism financing.

In the days following the Senate hearing in February, two House subcommittees held a hearing on blockchain, which, while it largely veered away from the topic of regulation, served as a platform for lawmakers to learn more about the technology.

"The Winklevoss twins have revealed plans for their crypto exchange Gemini, to begin trading Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash this year. At present, Gemini only trades Bitcoin and Ethereum. Speaking to media at a Cboe event held in Florida, Tyler Winklevoss confirmed that expansion of Gemini’s offerings would be “from the Satoshi Nakamoto family tree – Bitcoin cash, Litecoin.”

The move comes in the wake of Gemini’s recent partnership with Cboe Global Markets Inc. The Cboe wants to begin trading futures contracts with cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, opening its exchange up to Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash would be of mutual benefit to both parties.

Gemini’s relationship with Cboe is based on an exclusive deal, whereby Gemini supplies Cboe with data that can be used to calculate their Bitcoin contracts. When the deal was announced, Tyler Winklevoss described the agreement as scalable, a clear hint at the potential for future expansion of offerings.

The addition of Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash to Gemini’s crypto exchange will see it equal main US rival Coindesk Inc. in terms of offerings. The move could also inspire a rise in the share price of both Gemini and Coindesk stock. Both companies benefited from a jump in value when Coindesk made the same expansion in offerings.

Speaking at a Cboe event in Florida, the Winklevoss twins also emphasised their confidence in cryptocurrency, despite the recent fall in price and trading volume of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency slumped to $8300 last week, with the price of Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Ripple also falling 11% respectively. Much of this drop-off can be attributed to an Mt. Gox trustee selling off $400 million USD of Bitcoin. But Tyler Winklevoss insisted that the long-term trend was still moving in the right direction, pointing to the days of when Bitcoin was worth just $8."
"Japan to urge G20 for steps to prevent cryptocurrency use for money laundering

Japan will urge its G20 counterparts at a meeting next week to beef up efforts to prevent cryptocurrencies from being used for money laundering, a government official with direct knowledge of the matter said.

But the prospects for the G20 finance leaders to agree on specific global rules and mention them in a joint communique are low, given differences in each country’s approach, the official said, a view echoed by another official involved in G20 talks.

“Discussions will focus on anti-money laundering steps and consumer protection, rather than how cryptocurrency trading could affect the banking system,” one of the officials said.

“The general feeling among the G20 members is that applying too stringent regulations won’t be good.”

Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of 20 major economies will meet in Buenos Aires on March 19-20, with cryptocurrencies set to be on the agenda.

The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a 37-nation group set up by the G7 industrial powers to fight illicit finance, will report to the G20 its findings on ways to keep cryptocurrencies from being used for money laundering.

Japanese policymakers fear that while there is broad consensus among the G20 nations on the need for such steps, some nations have looser regulations than others, which leaves loopholes for money laundering, the official said.

Japan was the first country to adopt a national system to oversee cryptocurrency trading, although it carried out checks on several exchanges this year after the theft of $530 million from one exchange, Coincheck Inc.

France and Germany have said they will make joint proposals to regulate the bitcoin cryptocurrency market. A head of the European Union’s watchdog said a short-term strategy could be to focus on applying anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules, warning consumers of the risk of trading in cryptocurrencies and preventing banks from holding them.

The trick would be to apply regulations to protect consumers and prevent illicit activity, without stifling innovation in the fast-growing crypto-currency and fintech sectors, the Japanese officials said.

"What do the FBI and Canada’s Binary Options Task Force have in common? When it comes to recent activity at Google, the duo might be responsible for causing an in-house backlash against cryptocurrency advertising.

Cryptocurrency and related financial products are undergoing a phase of regulatory scrutiny from institutions like the SEC, IRS, and CFTC. While rich debate around regulating cryptocurrencies themselves will continue, a new conversation about advertisements for the asset class is emerging.

On January 30, 2018, Facebook took an early initiative to curb the flow of ""ads that promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency,"" as published in the company's new advertising policy.

Several weeks later, Jason Roy, a senior investigator for the Manitoba Securities Commission, as well as chairman of Canada's Binary Options Task Force (BOTF), proclaimed that it was the BOTF in conjunction with the FBI which had leaned on Facebook to concerns over cryptocurrency-related ads that ""are leading to people becoming victims.""

Roy went on to disclose that the two organizations have also been applying this pressure on Google for months.

When asked about this revelation, Google denied that a policy change was necessary, stating, ""we already ban and enforce against misleading ads and misrepresentation (across all categories).""

However, some advertisers who use Google Ads and YouTube (a subsidiary of Google) have recently been dissatisfied with their experience, when it comes to crypto promotion.

According to Finance Magnates, an anonymous ICO marketing company has produced data tables that depict a sharp decline in its daily AdWords performance, which apparently dropped by thousands of clicks in a matter of hours. The phenomenon experienced by the unidentified crypto-advertiser could be explained by other means. For example, a self-selected AdWords delivery method utilizing the ""accelerated"" functionality uses up an advertisers marketing budget as fast as possible, whereas the ""standard"" delivery option uses Google's algorithm(s) to allocate the daily ad expenditure of a campaign over the course of an entire day.

It's also possible that, due to the spreading public awareness that many ICOs are a risky bets or downright scams, web surfers may just not be clicking the bait much anymore.

Although Google has stated that it ""will rename and reorganize some … AdWords policies"" this month, it is unclear if the tech powerhouse has been specifically targeting crypto ads, unbeknownst to regulators or advertisers.

We know one thing for certain: Roy says his agency and the FBI have been having similar discussions with Google as they had with Facebook in the lead up to the social media giant's crypto ad ban."
"Even though he's now retired, Alan Wiener continues to keep up with events in the financial markets following a career in finance services.

After researching cryptocurrency, he decided to invest.

And to manage that transfer, Alan chose Coinbase, a digital currency exchange.

He wired the money from his wife's bank account to the Coinbase account in his name, but the money never showed up.

After a few days, he learned that for wire transfers, the names on the accounts must match.

Alan says he's e-mailed Coinbase several times and made phone calls asking about his money.

Alan did end up getting his $30,000 after the reporter contacted Coinbase.

The company says you should know the name on the bank wire must match the legal name on the Coinbase account and you must include your reference code."
"One of the biggest problems facing the cryptocurrency market today is the spread of false and negative news. Such news can dissuade newbies from investing in an otherwise excellent blockchain project. Take Substratum (Sub) for example, this project intends to decentralize the internet and make it free for all. That’s a big deal and has the potential to make issues like net neutrality debates irrelevant. Yet in spite of this fundamental strengths, Substratum has been hit with a number of negative news that would discourage an uninformed investor from putting their money in it.

Luckily, the team has managed to fight back against FUD, and its winning big time.

For instance, there was a FUD that this project has no working product. This was meant to portray Substratum (SUB) as a blockchain project that will never take off. The substratum team has killed off this FUD by launching a beta version of the project. On this beta version that is already being tested, 100 people will be added every day.  The team intends to open up the system to the public after a few weeks of beta testing. This is an early sign that Substratum is headed for mass adoption in the near future.

There was also a FUD going around that Substratum is centralized, which essentially would mean that it is not a cryptocurrency. However, the team has proven that this FUD has no basis. The project has announced that it will be releasing version 3 of its open decentralized internet platform, and it will be completely open-source. Once released, this is guaranteed to quickly open up the concept of free internet, and this coin is guaranteed to hit the stratosphere.

All this FUD points to one thing, and that’s the fact that either the people spreading them don’t understand blockchain technology, or it’s the competition trying to play dirty in an attempt to increase their own acceptability. Luckily, the substratum (SUB) team has managed to squash these negative news with concrete evidence of project growth. That’s something that many other good projects that have suffered FUD have not done, and investors have been hurt in the ensuing sell-offs.

As an investor, this should be a wakeup call for you to do your due diligence before investing in a coin. When you invest based on concrete research, it would be difficult for any FUD to affect your investment. That’s because you would have the confidence to wait it out even when the price collapses. Remember that even more established coins like bitcoin have been hit by FUD in the past, and their prices shaken. But for those who have had the courage to hang on, they have reaped massive benefits, once the negative news have passed.

In the case of Substratum (SUB), now that they have managed to beat negative news by showing concrete steps in the right direction, you can expect the value of this project to increase significantly, once the overall market turns bullish. Remember this is a project that aims to disrupt the internet as we know it today, so its potential for growth is almost infinite.

This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrencies or a recommendation to invest. Historic performance is no guarantee of future returns. As an investment class, cryptocurrencies are speculative investments and investing in cryptocurrencies involves significant risks – they are highly volatile, vulnerable to hacking and capital loss and sensitive to secondary activity. Before investing you should obtain advice and decide whether the potential return outweighs the risks."

"When it comes to digital theft, there is one aspect which is frequently misunderstood and miscommunicated.

Despite popular belief, a thief isn’t stealing an individual’s asset itself (SSN, phone number, money); rather, he or she is stealing the key to acquiring that SSN, phone number, and/or money, at least initially. The key unlocks the means by which to obtain that information.

When it comes to cryptocurrency theft, the same logic applies.

Whether we are talking Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or any other virtual currency, the most important thing to remember is that they don’t physically exist. A virtual currency is nothing more than a digital ledger (think checkbook ledger or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet) known as a blockchain. Similar to a checkbook ledger or other spreadsheet, the blockchain stores and manages an ever-growing list of addresses and the number of units of a currency there are at those specific addresses.

What you as an owner of cryptocurrency actually hold is a cryptographic key, not the unit of currency (BTC, LTC, ETC, etc.) itself, because it doesn’t actually exist. The key allows a holder to unlock the address where that unit is located. The value that attracts thieves and attackers is the open ledger itself, which you have access to with your cryptographic key.

The issue when it comes to cryptotheft is that attackers are coming after your key, and nothing more. As for the methods they use to acquire that key — well, that’s what you need to protect yourself from.

“Only secrecy of the key provides security,” said Auguste Kerckhoffs, a 19th-century cryptographer. His fundamental principle was that a cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. Once an attacker acquires one’s cryptographic key, however, he or she has access to everything behind the database. Kerckhoffs’s principle was reformulated by American mathematician Claude Shannon, who coined the principle the enemy knows the system.

The next stage to a theft is obtaining a platform on which to transfer the stolen cryptocurrency. Such platforms, mixers and tumblers, take the stolen coins and mix them with those of other users, creating a new transaction address. Consequently, the blockchain is unable to associate the stolen currency with the addresses from which they were taken. In other words, the blockchain is confused.

However, attackers are careful in regards to the tumblers and mixers they use in terms of delivering or accessing certain information.

Since the emergence of this new digital paradigm, many merchants are not yet sold on it. While the idea behind crypto is the decentralized market, willingness to accept cryptocurrency in lieu of other forms of payment is minimal. Thus, the need to convert one’s coin(s) to other currencies. This is done using Coinbase, Ripple, and other platforms. However, these platforms require one to provide sensitive information to open an account. Once accounts are created and the crypto converted, an attacker has completed the last stage of the theft.

But not all attackers clear up their digital footprints, and hence are still vulnerable to discovery."

"There’s no definitive way to tell if an initial coin offering (ICO) is a scam, but a machine learning-based research method could make it easier to avoid the most obvious ones. And that’s good for everyone except the scammers.

A Chinese startup called Shannon.AI, working with researchers from Stanford, University of California Santa Barbara, and the University of Michigan, recently unveiled a white paper detailing an AI designed to sniff out cryptocurrency scams.

When it comes to cryptocurrency investing there’s only one sure-fire way to avoid getting scammed: don’t do it. Sure, the Bitcoin bros and millennial millionaires make it look like we can all drive our lambos to the moon if we invest, but the reality is the majority of ICOs last year were either scams or failed.

As the researchers put it in their white paper:

So how do you separate the scams from the legitimate contenders when they all seem like techno-babble to anyone who isn’t well-versed in reading white papers?

There’s no easy answer. An almost complete lack of any regulation makes it impossible to ‘prove’ a scam until it’s too late. This isn’t about spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). It’s simple facts.

Part of the reason for this is white papers and websites can be made to look legitimate with relative ease. Simply put, most scammers are counting on the fact that you won’t dedicate as much time to researching their coin as they can to making it appear legitimate.

The problem is made even worse by the general toxicity and shill-like nature of the vast majority of cryptocurrency communities. When you have a large group of people whose common denominator is a mutual investment, coupled by bounty programs for spreading positive messages, it becomes impossible to get a clear picture of a coin’s legitimacy by talking to the people involved with it.

The Shannon.AI team’s white paper outlines a machine learning approach to separating the scams from legitimate projects:

And this is encouraging, even if it isn’t revolutionary. This particular paper showcases an algorithm-based system that essentially automates what savvy investors are already doing by seeking out publicly available information that draws an overall picture of a coin. This is good for a couple of reasons, as the team points out:

Sadly, due to the nature of these scams, when human researchers point out the red flags of a project that appears to be a scam those warnings are usually dismissed by cryptocurrency holders as “paid attacks” or FUD, even when they come from reputable news sites.

It’s easier for a company to attack the messenger than fix any problems pointed out by legitimate researchers and journalists.

But if an AI working in a black box comes to the same conclusions, based on the same readily available information, it could be considered more trustworthy. The Shannon.AI algorithms don’t do anything a person couldn’t do on their own, but they do it much, much faster — and with greater accuracy.

Unless you’re a journalist or researcher who has the luxury of spending days at a time poring over white papers, websites, and Github repositories, you’re probably missing key pieces of information. AI that does the same job in a fraction of the time could make scam ICOs a thing of the past, or at least the minority.

We’ve reached out to the research team to see if there’s any plans to go to market with this tool, or if they’ll be further developing it.

In the mean time, trade with care: for every person who made millions investing in altcoins there are thousands of people who wished they’d paid attention to the red flags before investing.

"Service NL is warning the public about a group claiming to be a cryptobank which is soliciting the public online through classified advertising services, social media and a website to invest in bitcoin blue, a cryptocurrency.

The group, known as Bitcoin Bank, is not registered to trade in securities in this province.

The website claims that the entity is located in California, but Service NL and other Canadian regulators have determined that it is not located at the address stated and that the advertised returns on investment are unrealistic.

Consumer warnings have been issued in Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.

Service NL cautions the public to check for the registration of any entity soliciting potential investors. If anyone has been contacted by, or had any dealings with Bitcoin Bank or any other suspected scams, they are encouraged to notify Service NL.

"Cryptocurrency is making headlines again—this time, in real estate. A pilot program in South Burlington, Vt.—initiated by global blockchain real estate marketplace Propy Inc.—marks the first U.S. deed recorded using only blockchain technology, according to multiple sources. In this case, Ethereum was used to transact and record contracts and documents instead of using the city’s recording system.

“The announcement of a pilot project to utilize blockchain technology in real estate transactions is emblematic of Vermont’s long history of innovating business, insurance and financial technology,” said Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary Michael Schirling in a statement. “We are fortunate to have a cutting-edge statutory framework that enables the use of blockchain technology, and we will continue to work with the legislature to ensure Vermont remains at the forefront of these innovations.”

The pilot program was announced in January in partnership with the City Clerk’s Office of South Burlington. City representatives say Vermont’s legislation lends flexibility to blockchain use in real estate transactions.

“The Propy pilot will showcase the savings of blockchain distributed technology, furthering Vermont’s and the City of South Burlington’s goal to achieve more cost-effective government,” said Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of Propy, in a statement. “In parallel to making land record management systems significantly more efficient, Propy’s additional safeguards ensure additional data integrity.”

If these blockchain pilot programs prove successful, brokerages may be more willing to transact using cryptocurrency. RE/MAX Action First in Tampa predicts that the technology is set to disrupt the industry and is prepared to embrace the use of cryptocurrency in real estate, stating transactions could be settled in minutes instead of multiple days or weeks. The brokerage is one of the first in Tampa Bay to accept and use cryptocurrency in real estate transactions.

“The most mysterious thing about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is why they aren’t used more,” said Kenny Hayslett, president of RE/MAX Action First in Tampa, in a statement. “It is simply digital money—a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to safely and securely transfer assets.”

In Sweden, the mapping and land registration authority is moving forward with blockchain technology, using cryptocurrencies to conduct property sales. It expects to complete the first transaction in the next few months, according to the Wall Street Journal. The practice becoming more commonplace overseas may signal to widespread use in U.S. real estate transactions in the near future; however, with volatility and security still at the forefront as major challenges, blockchain needs to make strides to bridge the gap and assuage consumers’ fraud-based fears. Related startups

are now emerging. The latest, according to Forbes—Messari—is based out of New York and vows to increase financial disclosures for cryptocurrencies. It is still in the early stages of seed funding before its product launch, but may be the solution to creating a public database for cryptocurrency data, helping investors to determine whether a blockchain-based transaction is safe or vulnerable.

Hayslett believes that these blockchain-based transactions could help eliminate fees, and, therefore, any unnecessary delays, but understands that security is the predominant concern; however, RE/MAX Action First says the industry should be more worried about wire transfers, a process that has been vulnerable to fraud in recent years.

“Real estate itself can be a tricky investment,” Hayslett said. “The clear advantage of using cryptocurrency throughout the exchange is that it can increase in value and reap great rewards for the seller.”

"Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies generally, are harming the development of productive applications of blockchain technology. The time has come to move past the fantasy of cryptocurrency riches and to productive uses of this technology.

One expert recently suggested as much, stating that “skepticism about the value of blockchain may be rooted in unease about its connection to bitcoin and other virtual currencies known as cryptocurrencies.”

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which handles more than half of all high-value, cross-border payments, concluded “that the technology is not ready for mainstream use,” after recently testing the blockchain technology.

SWIFT added that “further progress is needed … before [blockchain] will be ready to support production-grade applications in large-scale, mission-critical global infrastructures.”

The “get rich quick” scheming of cryptocurrency promoters has exacerbated the skepticism about blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT).

That focus on cryptocurrencies has diverted attention from what DLT actually is and its potential once certain practical limitations of DLT have been overcome. That potential includes minimizing fraud, ensuring data accuracy, speeding up transactions and reducing the cost of running a DLT system.

While cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to minimize fraud, it is fraud, in fact, in the form of numerous thefts of cryptocurrencies, that is a serious, ongoing problem.

Presumably, cryptocurrency fraud is prevented, or at least minimized, by multiple independent parties processing the same transaction in parallel; that is, by each party adding a new transaction to an existing set, or “block” of transactions.

The creation and maintenance of these independent records — a chain of title — make it impossible to later alter that chain of title through a subsequent manipulation of transaction data in the several independent DLT databases.

However, cryptocurrency fraud occurs in the exchanges where electronic wallets holding cryptocurrencies that have been purchased on the exchange are subsequently pilfered through computer hacks. Recovering this stolen property has proven to be very challenging.

The literal application of blockchain technology – the addition of a new transaction to a group or block of previous transactions affecting a discrete item and the encryption and multiple replications of the just-updated block – does not protect against the entering of erroneous data into the block, rendering it worthless.

No amount of subsequent data replication or blockchain consensus will correct that problem – it can be fixed only by entering a correcting transaction.

The pursuit of accuracy strongly suggests a central authority or governing body must oversee a specific application of DLT in a “permissioned” environment, with pre-agreed rules and procedures to ensure the accurate entry of transaction data into the DTL ledger, the prompt correction of data-entry errors and overall data integrity.

Only those who agree to play by the rules established for the DLT shall be authorized to enter data into and/or access the database overseen by that governing authority.

Replicating blocks of data through independent processors — the mining process for many cryptocurrencies – to ensure accurate processing of transactions in the database has rapidly diminishing value as the number of replications increases.

More specifically, it is highly unlikely that the third, fourth or fifth replication of the entry of a new transaction will reveal processing errors or fraudulent data that the first or second replication did not catch, yet each additional replication and consensus check possibly slows the processing of individual transactions while adding cost.

It is hard to imagine why more than two or three replications of transaction data by the computers processing those transactions on geographically dispersed ledgers is necessary to ensure 100 percent transaction accuracy.

A real-world application of DLT will occur only if it makes economic sense. An application that minimizes the potential for fraud, is highly accurate and very fast in executing transactions will not be implemented if it is more costly to operate than an alternative, less sophisticated technology.

One unfortunate aspect of cryptocurrencies is that the substantial cost of keeping a cryptocurrency operational, through the highly repetitive processing of cryptocurrency transactions, is not readily evident.

Those costs — electricity, computer chips and other hardware and high-skilled labor — are masked by the creation of additional cryptocurrency coins that cryptocurrency “miners” earn by processing the transactions of a particular cryptocurrency. They then sell those coins to cover their costs and earn a profit. These miners are gambling every day that the coins they earn will at least cover their costs.

Recent news articles have drawn attention to the enormous amount of electricity the crypto miners use, with negative environmental consequences, their intense demand for computer-processing chips, and even their possible drag on American productivity.

The ongoing decline in cryptocurrency prices, coupled with the increased resource consumption for each additional coin that is created, raises this question: How much longer will the cryptocurrency gamble continue to pay off for crypto miners?

This question suggests that viable, long-term applications of DLT cannot depend upon an ever-appreciating price of an ethereal “currency” that has no intrinsic value and only very limited utility as an actual currency.

"The team behind a soon-to-be-launched cryptocurrency has issued the notable claim that it will be un-forkable.

Announced today, Hedera is a public network built on Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) developed by the software company Swirlds, which has already deployed private versions with several enterprise clients.

Hedera Hashgraph, the governing body for the network, raised $18 million through a private sale of the as-yet-to-be-named token in January. That sale, the company said, represented less than 20% of the total supply.

Different than a blockchain, Hashgraph is billed as more secure, scalable and ""fairer"" than either the proof-of-work mechanism securing bitcoin or the permissioned systems that banks and other corporations have been experimenting with. The creators say the Hedera version can facilitate micropayments, distributed file storage and support smart contracts out of the gate.

And they've landed a prominent user - MZ, formerly Machine Zone, a game developer behind popular apps like Mobile Strike, said it would build distributed applications on top of the protocol.

But perhaps what's most striking about Hedera is the use of a patented - rather than open-source - codebase in an otherwise open network.

While the code will be publicly reviewable, and developers will be free to build applications on top of the network without a license, the governing body for Hedera says it will enforce the patent to prevent copying of the codebase or the creation of a competing platform and associated currency.

Mance Harmon, a co-founder and the CEO of Swirlds, calls this situation ""transparency with stability.""

""We can guarantee our platform will never fork,"" he told CoinDesk, adding that it will be ""one platform with one currency forever.""

While the option of forking is viewed by many in crypto as a positive, since it allows those unhappy with a particular project's direction to go their own way (not to mention sometimes providing free money to those who hold the original token), ""we view that as a hindrance to mainstream market adoption,"" Harmon said.

Hedera's white paper lays out the rationale this way:

Swirlds, which patented the network technology, granted an irrevocable license to Hedera Hashgraph, the governing body, for use in the public network, according to Harmon.

In another departure from the usual set-up of a public network, the actual governance process for Hedera is permissioned, or restricted to only certain parties.

Hedera Hashgraph consists of 39 ""known and reputable organizations,"" according to the white paper, all of whom collectively own two-thirds of the supply of the network's token.

Swirlds is one of the 39, and a spokeswoman said the other names would be announced in the coming weeks. Harmon said they include banks as well as companies working in the healthcare, media and legal industries.

""The goal was to make sure no single party has no more or less influence over the network than any single party,"" said Harmon. All the 39 members are ""on par with one another,"" he explained.

The model was the governing structure that Dee Hock used in 1968 to create National BankAmericard, which is known today as Visa - again, not the usual cypherpunk inspiration. According to the white paper, the governing body will control the money supply and manage changes to the codebase.

"Article by David Drake, full bio at the bottom

Last week, two world-known U.S. brands – Amazon and Starbucks – alluded to plans to  either integrate virtual currency or blockchain technology in their corporate models.

LendEDU queried 1000 Amazon clients on whether they would use the ‘Amazon Coin’ if the company was to  launch it.. Results showed that more than 50 percent of the participants said they would.

On the other hand, Howard Schultz, Starbucks Chairman, commented that blockchain will most possibly be the backbone of their integrated app in the near future.

If these two brands push through with these plans, this will lead to an increase in users within the cryptocurrency space. 2017 data from Statista shows that Starbucks’ global revenue stood at $22.39 billion and the number of stores at 27,339 globally.  . The revenue of the company and its stores have increased annually in the the past 10 years, except in 2009. Similarly, Amazon’s reach is global, selling to millions of customers.

Fire Lotto CEO, Roman Demidov, says, “We think that implementation of blockchain to the business model of world known companies will bring more crypto users. The market will grow. And people will learn more about the blockchain.”

Online businesses like Amazon or  a brick-and-mortar businesses like  Starbucks make an impressive presence in the cryptocurrency industry. They are recognized brands and have a major following.

Jean Pierre Rukebesha, co-founder and CFO of GN Compass, says, “Amazon and Starbucks joining the blockchain revolution is bridging the gap and may be what the world has been waiting for to confirm their passage towards blockchain and cryptocurrency driven economies.”

He further adds,  “For a start, when Amazon speaks, everybody has to listen especially the regulators and all those who have been on record preaching doom and calamity brought  by cryptocurrency. Second, for the world community, it is great, from an educational point of view – Bill Gates vs Jeff Bezos! It is your call.”

More than $300 million was raised through ICOs from 2014 to 2016, with 64 major ICOs held in 2016 that raised a total of $103 million. Five of the largest ICOs in 2017 raised a total of  $966 million. Cryptocurrency is a novel asset that is still in its infancy, and need to grow.

CEO of ClearCoin, Jay Singh, says, “If Amazon or Starbucks started their own cryptocurrency, it would be one of the all time greatest mainstream signals of validation for the crypto economy. These companies could easily surpass Telegram’s ongoing $1 billion ICO.”

"The Iowa City Area Chamber of Commerce is now accepting Bitcoin payments for membership dues.

 

 Chamber President Kim Casko made the surprise announcement this morning at Iowa City’s TechBrew meeting, a monthly event hosted by the Technology Association of Iowa. The chamber accepted its first Bitcoin payment on Friday, she said.

 

 “Cryptocurrency is becoming more and more popular, especially in our community. There’s a ton of startup businesses forming around this technology,” Casko said. “We thought, ‘Let’s be ahead of trend.’ ” 

 

 After working with University of Iowa student Cameron Schorg, the chamber set up a bitcoin wallet through BitPay. Once the chamber receives payment through BitPay, the payment can be transferred to U.S. dollars with a small transaction fee and deposited in the chamber’s regular bank accounts. 

 

 The chamber began working on accepting the international cryptocurrency after Schorg inquired about becoming a Chamber of Commerce member. As of Tuesday, no other area business has asked to pay membership dues through Bitcoin, Casko said, although some Iowa City businesses are dealing directly with cryptocurrency markets. 

 

 “We’ll see. Based on the news getting out today, I don’t know if more will look to join. If they are, we’re capable of receiving that payment now,” Casko said. “I think the next step is to look at where else do we want to accept it and what would that look like.” 

 

 Is it the first Chamber of Commerce to accept Bitcoin payments? Chamber staff members have tried to verify that -- calling national Chamber of Commerce professional associations, and branches in New York City, Austin, Texas and Silicon Valley. So far, they have only identified one chamber of digital commerce based in Washington, D.C., Casko said. 

 

 They did beat one big name -- while Overstock and Expedia accept transactions using Bitcoin, internet giant Amazon has yet to announce plans surrounding cryptocurrency payments. 

 

 “Everyone’s waiting to hear if they’re going to accept it or not, and we’re tracking that too. It’s kind of fun for us to say, ‘well, we beat Amazon,’” Casko said."

"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance was the target of a hacking attempt on March 7th, and they aren't happy about it. In an article from Binance, they announced that they are offering a $250,000 USD equivalent bounty to anyone who supplies information that leads to the arrest of the hackers involved with the attempt on March 7th. Furthermore, the company has stated that they have allocated the equivalent of $10 million USD in crypto reserves for future bounty awards against and other hacking attempts on Binance.

Of course the bounties will be paid in Binance Coin, which very well may be worthless when you get it, or worthless right now depending on your feelings on cryptocurrency.

To ensure a safe crypto community, we can’t simply play defense. We need to actively prevent any instances of hacking before they occur, as well as follow through after-the-fact. Even though the hacking attempt against Binance on March 7th was not successful, it was clear it was a large-scale, organized effort. This needs to be addressed."

Cryptocurrency has its risks and certainly isn't for everyone.

Just how hesitant are they? The deVere group, one of the world’s largest independent financial services organizations chose to find out.

In a survey with over 800 respondents deVere clients  from the U.S, the UK, Australia, the UAE, Qatar, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Spain, France, Germany and South Africa revealed whether or not they would include cryptocurrency in their portfolio.

The survey showed that 6 out of 10 people with currently no exposure to cryptocurrencies would consider including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin into their investment portfolios and that 7 out of 10 people who do hold cryptocurrencies are planning to increase their exposure in the next 12 months.

When asked,“Would you consider, or are you considering, including at least one cryptocurrency into your investment portfolio?”  62 % of those who do not have any cryptocurrency said ‘yes’, 26% said ‘no’, and 12 % said, ‘do not know,’ Of the investors who already had cryptocurrencies as part of their porfolio, 71% said they were looking to increase the exposure over the next year, 25% said they would not, and 4 % cited that they did not know.

DeVere Group’s founder and CEO, Nigel Green, comments: “The fact that more than 60 per cent of people with currently no exposure to cryptocurrencies would consider including them into their investment portfolios is striking. It underscores how, despite what many financial traditionalists have opined, that a majority of investors are now open to consider the opportunities that the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple could present.""

He continues: “The survey also highlights that the majority of those who do currently hold some cryptocurrency as part of their investment portfolio believe that despite ongoing volatility, the potential rewards will outweigh the potential risks.

Recently, The Winklevoss twins, brothers who run the Gemini exchange for trading Bitcoin and Ether proposed the Virtual Commodity Association. This would be a self-regulatory organization meant to police digital-currency markets and custodians that would work with regulators like U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to prevent fraud.

"The US state of Wyoming has now created a new class of assets in defining cryptocurrency as “Utility Tokens”, reports Forbes March 13.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the Wyoming state legislature passed House Bill 70 on March 6, which effectively exempts crypto from state securities regulations. The bill was signed into law by Governor Matt Mead March 8.

The new law excludes developers and sellers of tokens from state securities laws under the condition that they meet a certain number of caveats, namely that it must be used as a token for the exchange of goods and services and must not be marketed as an investment.

Co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition Caitlin Long remarked on the important precedent set by the new law:

“The state of Wyoming is the first elected body in the world to define a utility token as a new type of asset class different from a security or commodity. This has been a hot topic in Washington D.C. recently, as the SEC considers cryptocurrencies to be securities, FinCEN says they’re generally money, and the CFTC views them as commodities. Now, however, you have a state coming out and defining utility tokens as a new form of property, and property is generally the purview of state law.”

Long and other members of the coalition believe that the new precedent may be a framework by which Washington will approach cryptocurrency regulation in the near future. Long added that, “I do believe the Wyoming approach will work under federal securities law and am optimistic the SEC will agree.”

House Bill 70 is one of five bills that have recently been turned into law in the state of Wyoming that aim to boost crypto and Blockchain businesses in the state. House Bill 19 amended the state’s money transmission laws that had previously prevented exchanges from effectively operating within the state; Coinbase and two other exchanges actually pulled out of the state in 2015. The remaining three pieces of legislation, all introduced by Long, aim to make Wyoming more competitive in attracting new crypto business.

House Bill 101 authorizes Wyoming corporations to create Blockchains to store records and the use of a network to identify shareholders and the acceptance of shareholder votes.

House Bill 126 allows the creation of “series LLCs” which are favorable to decentralized protocols as it enables LLCs to establish a compartmentalized series of members/managers, transferable interests or assets, and distributions to members. Senate Bill 111 exempts cryptocurrency from Wyoming state property taxes.

Speaking to Forbes, Governor Mead mentioned the proactive measures the state has been taking to turn Wyoming into, “a big technology state” including the establishment of the ENDOW Executive Council; Economically Needed Diversity Options for Wyoming."
"The Sichuan mountains located in China, the Columbia basin that runs through Seattle and Grindavík in Iceland all have something in common. Though these places are hundreds of miles apart from each other, they play a significant role in keeping various cryptocurrencies running. These locations host the world’s most extensive commercial digital currency mining operations.

It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 people globally who contribute to the cryptocurrency mining network. The number of miners may be large, but the highest share of the total mining resources are held by the most extensive miners who have successfully made commercial mining rigs. These commercial mining farms have popped up in locations far and wide as miners search for cheaper electricity to keep the machines running. It has been reported in Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index that bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption is 29.05 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) which is more than the total electricity consumption of 159 countries. It is also estimated that electricity used by processors involved in mining will exceed the energy demand of Ireland in 2018.

Mining bitcoin was not a tough task in the early days. When bitcoin was launched in 2009, it was the first proof of work application that used computational resources to verify transactions that would take place on the network. The verification would be done by so-called ‘miners.’ Back then, it was completely feasible to mine bitcoin on desktop computers, but as more miners joined the network, they pushed up the mining difficulty. As a result, mining was no longer economically viable on consumer grade hardware.

Miners are paid in cryptocurrencies as a reward for mining. It must be noted that not all cryptocurrencies can be mined, only cryptocurrencies that use the proof of work protocol can be mined and not the ones using proof of system concept. Bitcoin and ethereum can be mined, but not ripple, as the latter follows the PoS-like protocol for verifying transactions.

Most mining rigs are located near an electricity generating station. The two major costs associated with mining are hardware expenses and the electricity cost. Locating the mine near an electricity station is the best way to get cheap electricity.

Take the city of Eastern Wenatchee, a small city at a three hours drive from Seattle, which has turned into a significant bitcoin mining hub. At two to three cents per kilowatt hour, electricity here is extremely cheap and the temperatures here are also low, which help in keeping the computer hardware cool. Old warehouses and now shut-down factories were a perfect place for miners that began arriving here since 2013. Back then, electricity was still cheap, and abundant.

A mining rig that consumed five megawatts of electricity would have made $140,000 every day when bitcoin prices were at their peak in December 2017.

China and Ireland are also home to some of the most prominent mines. According to a study, these mines draw several megawatts of electricity which would otherwise be sufficient to light up a thousand houses. There are also concerns that the electricity being used for mining could result in a significant increase in bills of other users too.

Utility companies situated along the Columbia basin keep drawing prospective miners from far away lands as well. However, authorities are now also beginning to view bitcoin mining as a threat. Citing commercial reasons, the council of Plattsburgh recently slapped an 18-month moratorium on all forms of commercial cryptocurrency mining.

Nevertheless, cryptocurrency mining is not all bad. If we look at the capacity utilization of all these power stations, we realize that most of the electricity produced was exported to the larger nearby cities at a premium and that there were no real long-term contracts where the producers could sell this excess power. In a way, bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining have opened up a new business model for these power companies too."
"New York State Assembly legislator Ron Kim (D-40) has unveiled a bill that intends to protect cryptocurrency investors and ease the bureaucratic burden on crypto-related businesses. It's the first comprehensive cryptocurrency bill in New York to make it past studies and commissions and into the hands of the legislative branch. Kim introduced the legislation on March 13, 2018, after he met with blockchain industry leaders on the subject. 



Known as The New York Cryptocurrency Exchange Act ( A9899 ), the bill relates to ""the audit of cryptocurrency business activity by third party depositories and prohibits licensing fees to conduct such cryptocurrency business activity.""

If it were to take effect, the legislation would make amendments to Section 9 of New York's Banking Law. With the addition of section 9-x, the law would mandate that any cryptocurrency business or entity be subject to routine audits by a public or third-party depository service. These audits would require that individuals and businesses alike safeguard assets with proper security measures, provide adequate insurance for account holder assets and produce proof-of-asset ownership.

Any entity in full compliance will receive a digital New York Seal of Approval to reassure consumers that the outlet is trustworthy and secure. This seal would ideally replace the BitLicenses currently issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services, doing away with this fee-based license in favor of one earned by audit.

Kim believes that earlier efforts to regulate the space have put enormous burdens on businesses trying to grow and operate in the cryptocurrency space. ""What New York needs now,"" he told Bitcoin Magazine , ""are common-sense laws and security procedures to provide a degree of clarity for both businesses and the public. This legislation will give consumers and companies the confidence needed for widespread adoption of cryptocurrency in New York.""

While the bill is the first of its kind for New York legislators, this isn't Kim's first foray into cryptocurrency. As a precursor to the landmark legislation, Kim recently published a brief report titled ""The Future of Bitcoin in NY."" His research identifies unregulated exchanges as ""the weak point"" in the blockchain ecosystem. This vulnerability, coupled with the cost of a BitLicense, has left New York lacking in legitimate crypto-companies and consumer confidence.

According to a statement from Kim's office, there are currently fewer than 10 BitLicense holders in the entire state of New York, even though there are some 1,000 active job postings in New York for the blockchain industry. It's Kim's hope that the new legislation will foster a friendlier environment for companies in the space; one that will attract more business and generate increased revenue by connecting consumers with reliable, state-vetted entities.

Throughout 2017, the United States government remained relatively quiet on the subject of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. While other countries are beginning to outline clear regulations and legislative guidelines , U.S. investors have had their ears filled with conflicting talk from the SEC, the CFTC and various state legislatures.

So far, however, it's been a busy year for the United State's regulatory efforts, both on federal and state levels, and The New York Cryptocurrency Exchange Act is yet another installment in a growing series of litigation that finally broaches the topic of cryptocurrency regulations. If anything, the legislation may set a precedent for consumer protections in the industry, as well as a more lenient regulatory approach that might encourage job growth in the industry."

"Bitcoin is famous as the cryptocurrency that introduced us to blockchain, a decentralized and transparent public ledger that used distributed computing to record transactions. But it was slow, and as Bitcoin became popular, that slowness in updating the ledger became obvious as it handled too few transactions per second.

Lots of entrepreneurs are working on speeding up the blockchain. But there’s something else out there called the hashgraph, another decentralized ledger that is billed as a fast and cheap alternative to blockchain. Today, the Hedera Hashgraph Council and MZ (formerly Machine Zone) are unveiling plans for a new distributed public ledger, the Hedera Hashgraph Platform.

This technology will be able to perform many transactions per second, and it could be the basis for a new level of trust and security in the online world, the supporters said. The Hedera group wants to use the ledger to enable anyone to make fast, secure, fair, and globally distributed applications. If you want to pause and watch this hashgraph video, be my guest.

The internet definitely has a trust problem. We’ve got loads of identity theft, cybercrime, spam, hacking, election manipulations, and digital spying — all things that have become the costs of living our lives online.

Hedera aims to change that with the release of a simple, powerful platform with robust applications programming interface (API) support to make it easy for developers to build global, distributed applications.

“We need a more trusted, secure and equitable online world,” said Leemon Baird, inventor of the hashgraph algorithm, in a statement. “You should be able to carve out a piece of cyberspace to create a shared world, be confident when interacting with others, feel safe online, control how you collaborate, and share only the information you want. Today we lay out the roadmap for how Hedera will make that happen.”

With the unveiling of the Hedera Hashgraph Platform, the council today also released speed test results, conducted on multiple Amazon Web Services platforms. The tests focused on achieving consensus on transaction order (resolving a ledger transaction) and timestamps for instances distributed across five continents.

The Hedera network was able to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, with time to finality within a few seconds. Hedera uses verification software that runs on the computer’s graphics card GPU to verify one million signatures per second. Such speed is crucial to enable use cases such as distributed gaming, stock and other markets, and micropayments, the group said.

MZ said it will build distributed applications on top of hashgraph.

“Our mission is to enable the next generation of many-to-many applications,” said Gabe Leydon, CEO of MZ, in a statement. “By building on top of Hedera hashgraph, our applications will be able to be deployed in a peer-to-peer environment, with complete fairness, transparency and visibility. We believe Hedera is revolutionary, and will change everyone’s expectations of how fair and fast applications and gaming can be.”

Public distributed ledgers provide decentralized systems that, in theory, anyone can participate in. But a recent peer-reviewed study, titled “Decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum,” which examined some of the largest networks between 2015 and 2017, found the opposite has become true.

The top four Bitcoin mining operations and top three Ethereum ones control more than 50 percent of the world’s hash rate, and the entire blockchain of both systems “is determined by fewer than 20 mining entities” due to both the proof-of-work requirements and the lack of a governance model that ensures continued decentralization over time, Hedera said.

Hedera aims to address both of these concerns by separating governance from consensus. The Consensus Model ensures that the Hedera network will expand to many millions of nodes voting on the order of transactions in a highly distributed network. The cryptoeconomics of the platform help to ensure the continued decentralization of consensus voting.

Hedera expects to enable anyone to run a node without having to pay for a mining rig or large amounts of electricity. Hedera will be governed by a council of leading corporations and organizations across multiple industries, bringing needed experience in process and business expertise. Membership criteria is designed to reflect a range of industries and geographies with respected, trusted brands and market positions. The proposed governance model will ensure that no single entity has complete control and that no group of members has undue influence over the body as a whole. Hedera will use a combination of technical and legal controls to give the governing council mechanisms to promote stability and ensure the network will never fork.

The Hedera technical framework includes an Opt-In Escrow Identity mechanism that gives users a means to bind verified identities to otherwise anonymous cryptocurrency wallets, with the aim of providing governments the necessary oversight to ensure regulatory compliance. This is completely optional, and each user can decide what kinds of credentials, if any, to reveal. Hedera intends to work with governments to bring the same level of security to public ledgers as is currently present in the financial system.

Further details on Hedera will be unveiled at a sold-out event tonight in New York City. The event can be livestreamed at www.hashgraph.com, starting at 3 p.m. Pacific time."
"Cryptocurrency exchanges are always looking for ways to make an even bigger impact. Binance, one of the world’s leading exchanges, has announced their major plans. More specifically, they are looking to set up a new trading platform that is completely decentralized. It is a rather intriguing decision, as it will seemingly “compete” with the platform we all know today.

Binance has quickly become one of the bigger cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Their altcoin trading volume has reached new heights many times over. It seems this growth also poses some problems for the company. Late last year, they briefly halted signups for a few weeks. That was a first sign of how things need to change sooner or later. It now appears a proper solution in the making, albeit one most people wouldn’t necessarily expect.

More specifically, it seems a completely new trading platform will be launched. A decentralized version of Binance will come to market in the near future. For now, there is no official release date, but it is expected this development won’t take long to complete. These plans have been in the pipelines for quite some time now, by the look of things.

All we know is how the new platform will be called Binance Chain. The project is in development as we speak, and it seems a lot of currencies will be supported. Which currencies those will be exactly, has yet to be officially determined. It is evident this platform will either rival or complement the existing Binance exchange. Both options are equally as likely right now.

It is good to see more companies embrace the decentralized exchange model. The new platform will also use the BNB currency as gas to power all trading. This will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the BNB price in the coming weeks and months. Given the overall bearish market sentiment right now, this is rather positive news for the industry as a whole. For now, a lot of details regarding Binance Chain remain unclear. More information will become available in the next few weeks and months."
"The Cambodian government’s attitude towards cryptocurrency seems to be very mixed, according to a variety of sources. For one thing, it has blocked cryptocurrency transactions while at the same time preparing to launch its own national cryptocurrency, according to the Phnom Penh Post.

The Cambodian cryptocurrency will be called Entapay. It has been described as a private blockchain, and the website says that it will offer storage management, trading, an exchange, and offline transactions. The token sale will begin on the 31st of March with a goal of 90,000 ETH, worth just over 62 million USD. The website proclaims: “One day, Entapay will replace VISA and become the new mainstream payment method.”

Interestingly, the Director General of the National Bank of Cambodia, Chea Serey, called cryptocurrency “a new form of fraud” in November, and later banned initial coin offerings in the country. In December, the bank said that it “never allowed the purchase, sale and circulation of any form of cryptocurrencies”.

However, it has not outlawed their use, and the popularity of cryptocurrency is growing.

Cambodia is a relatively poor Southeast Asian country of around 15 million people, governed by a constitutional monarchy. It lacks a developed financial infrastructure – for example, there is a shortage of cash machines. The central bank sees blockchain technology as a way of both developing the banking industry and breaking free of the country’s reliance on the US dollar, according to CCN.

When the government first announced the development of the national blockchain (in partnership with a Japanese company called Soramitsu) in June 2017, Serey said: “A cashless system is less costly and more transparent for the whole economy. This has always been on our agenda.”

These mixed messages have reportedly led to banks refusing to allow customers to execute transactions with cryptocurrency-oriented entities. However, there there are a number of businesses that accept cryptocurrency in capital, according to the blog of CryptoAsia, a Cambodian Bitcoin payment company.

CryptoAsia offers Bitcoin payment widgets for websites, and it was actually the first such service in the country. The company was founded by Steve Miller, who has lived in Cambodia for eight years, according to Forbes. Apparently, Miller has been attempting to build a Bitcoin community in the country, including opening a restaurant that accepts Bitcoin from his alley-facing apartment in the capital.

Another example of a cryptocurrency native to Cambodia is KHcoin. Khcoin was launched in October 2017 with donated funds by a cryptocurrency enthusiast named In Mean.

It trades at .000000999 BTC on one obscure exchange, and Mean says that he is giving it away for free – he told the Phnom Penh Post that when he tried to charge money, the national regulator stopped him: “I wanted to bring value to my coin, but when I started my payment system, the national bank said, ‘Any crypto transaction is illegal’.” KHcoin is currently listed as a non-profit organisation.

Despite the obstacles put up by the government, some are optimistic. Rithy Thul, Cambodian entrepreneur, said: “I think it is a good sign that the [NBC] is trying to use blockchain technology, because it will be more likely to endorse future blockchain projects.”

Mean told the Phnom Penh Post: “When the NBC changes its mind, I will be ready.”"
"Blockchain is one of the hottest topics in the accounting and financial services field, but a substantial amount of uncertainty remains.

While it may have appeared only recently in the public conversation, blockchain reinforces and expands upon existing technological tools and options long available to CPAs and other financial professionals. The American Institute of CPAs has partnered with the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance to educate and inform members of the profession just what blockchain means for the profession and accounting services moving forward.

During a recent AICPA Forensic and Valuation Services webinar, Ron Quaranta, who leads the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance, examined the implications and applications of blockchain in the accounting profession. A common misconception of blockchain technology is that it represents a financial reporting system, a journal entry platform, or an accounting data option, he noted. He highlighted some of the most common questions as CPAs grapple with this new technology.

Three questions that CPAs will inevitably be asked, regardless of whether they are employed in public practice or industry, include the following:

Is blockchain the same thing as bitcoin?

No, bitcoin is an application that runs on blockchain technology, just like different websites and applications run on the TCP/IP infrastructure that runs the internet. Without blockchain technology, the cryptocurrency market and business case would not exist as it currently does in the marketplace.

What does blockchain actually do that is different from existing options?

Blockchain, at its core, is a database operating in the cloud that stores a variety of information, including financial and nonfinancial information. Any information uploaded onto the blockchain network is verified and approved by existing members of the network prior to final approval and addition, and is then distributed to network members in real time. This security, and subsequent encryption of data once it has been approved and added means that data on the blockchain is theoretically secured against data hacks and breaches (although there have been reports of data breaches and hacking activity on cryptocurrency exchanges).

A fear among CPAs, and any industry disrupted by a dramatic technological change, is that the implementation of this technology will lead to job displacement and job loss among members of the profession. The AICPA-WSBA webinar addressed some of these concerns.

Automation is not the enemy of CPAs. It is true that automation will result in some job displacement and disruption within the profession, but that is no reason to fear the coming implementation of blockchain technology. As lower-level services, including account reconciliations, bank reconciliations, confirmations, receivables and payables are delegated to a blockchain platform, CPAs are better able to occupy and move into higher-level advisory services. Many CPAs, both individual practitioners and firms, are already moving in this direction; blockchain simply facilitates this transition.

Audit, attest and tax reporting will become more efficient. One of the biggest pain points in the current cycle of accounting and attestation services is the lag that occurs during the review, analysis and reporting process. Audits and other attestation services are among the targets of this criticism, which can be at least partially offset by the real-time nature of how information is communicated via blockchain. In addition to the real-time transference of information and data, since all data is verified and confirmed by interested parties on a continuous basis, the effort required to confirm and report tax related information will be much lower.

Especially during tax season, the implications and applications for blockchain technology on the accounting function and processes on the taxation and valuation processes will become an increasingly hot topic. The AICPA-WSBA webinar addressed these issues, while also highlighting the upside of including blockchain in the taxation and asset valuation/reporting conversation:

Blockchain reduces the opportunity for errors and fraud. A major issue with fraud and attestation reporting is that these transactions and information are possibly influenced by employees working for the organization. Since blockchain requires all information uploaded and included in the blockchain environment to be verified and confirmed by existing members of the network, this reduces the chances that data will be recorded and reported erroneously.

Blockchain makes tax reporting less complicated. Tax reporting, especially in the wake of the tax reform law enacted last December, tends to be an especially fraught time of year for both clients and CPAs, but blockchain can assist with this process. In short, if all of the information is recorded and approved by existing members of the network, tax-related information and data is available for examination and analysis. For CPAs, this means they are able to offer more real time advice and guidance to clients as they negotiate the taxation landscape.

Blockchain is a topic that inspires equal parts fear and excitement among accounting professionals, but it does not have to be something that remains unknown. By leveraging the available resources in the market, including those provided by the AICPA and the WSBA, CPAs and other accounting professionals will be well positioned to thrive in this rapidly changing business environment."
"Steem (STEEM) had a good 24 hours as the cryptocurrency jumped $0.0112999999999999 or 0.45% trading at $2.512.

Steem (STEEM) is down -31.74% in the last 30 days from $3.68 per coin. Its up 104.23% in the last 100 days since when traded at $1.23 and the annual trend is up. 200 days ago STEEM traded at $1.39. STEEM has 99.69M coins mined giving it $250.43 million market cap. Steem maximum coins available are 99.69M. STEEM uses algorithm and PoW proof type. It was started on 04/07/2015.

Steem.it is a blockchain-based social media platform where anyone can earn rewards by posting relevant content, curating quality content by upvoting and by holding Steem based currencies in a vest fund, which generates interest.

There are three main currencies in Steemit: Steem, Steem Power (SP) and Steem Backed Dollars (SBD).

Steem is liquid and can be bought in an exchange and converted into steem dollars or steem power.

Steem Power is basically Steem that is locked in a vesting fund for 3 months. Users can use steem power to upvote content and get curating rewards.

When a user upvotes content his steem power gets depleted and then slowly regenerated. Steem Power holders recieve interest from their holdings. The more Steem Power a voter has the more revenue he’ll generate for himself (in form of SP) and for the content creator  (In SBD).

There is also an incentive to upvote content early, as the rewards are distributed according to time. The earliest votes gets the biggest share of the reward.

Steem Backed Dollars are there to protect content creators from volatitlity and can be traded for roughly 1 usd worth of steem, in order to cash out from steem. Converting Steem backed dollars into STEEM takes 5 days. Users also recieve interest from holding SBD. T

Steem is a proof of work currency with a scheduled blocktime of 3 seconds. Steem PoW mining is done in rounds of 63 seconds by 21 miners (witnesses). 19 of the miners are pre voted, one is the other with the most computational power, and the last one is selected from a queue of witnesses that did not get on the top 19 voted witnesses.

90% of the block reward is allocated to a vest fund to reward curators and PoW miners, the other 10% are made liquid in the form of steem and are used to reward content creators. Steem gets converted to Steem Backed Dollars and sent to the content creator."

"While you may be tempted to think that open-source, decentralized, anonymous cryptocurrencies are safe because they are free of control from a single authority and work in a transparent manner, the reality is, they are constant targets for scams, including digital theft, phishing, fraud, and hacking. (For more, see Beware of these Five Bitcoin Scams.)

In a recent finding by Bitcoin.com News, $1.36 billion worth of cryptocurrencies have been stolen by fraudsters during the first two months of 2018.

Fraud constituted the majority of virtual currency scams, at 30 percent. It was followed by hacking attempts (22 percent), theft and exit scams (17 percent each), and phishing (13 percent).

The biggest recent heist occurred at cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc in late January, where hackers made off with almost $500 million in virtual tokens. (See more: Coincheck May Have Suffered The Worst Hack In Cryptocurrency History.)

Around the same time, Bitconnect, a cryptocurrency-lending scheme, shut down its operations and vanished, leading to an exit scam with an estimated loss of around $250 million.

And in February, an Italian crypto exchange called BitGrail reported that it was hit with a hacking attempt that led to a loss of nearly $195 million worth of customers' virtual tokens.

Due to the anonymous nature of the cryptocurrency market, not all small-sized scams may come to the fore. With the ever evolving nature of various cryptocurrencies and their related processes like initial coin offerings (ICO), it is also difficult to accurately measure the scope of each scam.

For instance, in January, AriseBank ICO was halted by the SEC for alleged forgery, as it attempted to raise funds from retail investors in the name of investing in the so-called world’s first “decentralized bank.” However, the ICO that originally aimed to raise $1 billion turned out to be a $600 million scam.

Even if the top three scams are considered outliers, the remaining smaller ones total a combined $542 million. Counting the 59 days of the first two months of 2018, the average per-day loss attributed to such small-ticket scams stands at around $9.1 million per day. If the trend continues, the total amount lost to such schemes would add up to around $3.25 billion by the end of the year, which would surpass the annual GDP of many small-sized nations!

With the increasing number of new cryptocurrencies being launched each day, and the evolution of associated services like trading, exchanges, and transfer services, the virtual currency world is getting far more complicated. Its anonymous and decentralized nature may be a boon to many, but can often be exploited by hucksters at the expense of the common user. (See also, Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin Scammer Stole My Cryptocurrency.)

While it may remain difficult to halt scams altogether, a balanced approach involving suitable regulations and security framework could help contain the epidemic. (See also, Bitcoin Blackmail Scam Is On The Rise: Watch Out.)

"Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins best known for operating digital-?currency exchange Gemini, have called operators in the cryptocurrency space to ?consider establishing a self-regulatory body called the Virtual Commodity Association (VCA).?

The two backers of virtual currencies are seeking to bring the digital ?asset class into the investing mainstream through an “SRO-like” entity — if they ?win the approval of the US regulators?.?

In a blog post, the Winklevoss twins submitted a proposal to adopt self-regulatory ?standards and industry-wide best practices to policing the new space amid ?the authorities and government mulling further possible regulatory action.?

Citing the success of SROs in the ?United Sates, the brothers advocated for the creation of a private, independent organization according to the ?following rules:

?“The VCA: (i) will be a non-profit, independent regulatory organization that ?does not operate any markets, (ii) will not be a trade association, (iii) will not ?provide regulatory programs for security tokens or security token platforms, ?and (iv) will be in compliance with global standards and best practices for ?SROs.”?

In remarks posted on Gemini’s website, the twins, that participated in the history of Facebook, addressed the issue of the proliferation ?of cryptocurrencies and ICO campaigns. They described various oversight and regulatory ?challenges including jurisdictional limitations that restrict CEA and CFTC authority over spot markets.?

They wrote: “The purchase and sale of commodities in the spot/cash ?markets has been historically exempt from the CEA and CFTC jurisdiction ?because cash market transactions, unlike derivative contracts, are: (i) ?traded for immediate delivery, (ii) settle “on the spot,” and (iii) are often ?underpinned by a commercial purpose (i.e., a farmer selling grain). As a ?result, these transactions are typically found to not be speculative in nature ?or readily susceptible to manipulation.”?

The proposed organization will require member firms to commit in writing to ?operating their offerings in compliance with sound practices and “provide a ?sanctions based accountability program to compel ongoing member ?compliance.”?

The VCA will be open for membership to virtual commodity platforms, over-?the-counter trading firms, and other trading facilities acting as ?counterparties."
"For electronic artists, cryptocurrency is the new credit.

Gramatik established his very own cryptocurrency, the GRMTK coin, back in November, a move that led the electro-funk producer to become the first artist to have his intellectual property tokenized. That same month, Gareth Emery announced the impending debut of Choon, a music streaming service and digital payments ecosystem built on an Ethereum blockchain base. 3LAU exhibited a similar affinity for digital currency in his composition and publication of a beginner’s guide to cryptocurrency in December.

Now, Don Diablo joins the crypto crew via HEXCOIN, the artist’s very own digital currency. Working in tandem with the block chain token, Gaze Coin, HEXCOIN enables HEXCOIN wallet owners to patronize HEXAGONIA, a virtual and augmented community in which those with HEXCOIN credit can purchase Don Diablo’s music and merchandise. The VR/AR/XR platform derives its name from Don Diablo’s podcast, Hexagonia, and his label, Hexagon.

Diablo fans need only to download the HEXCOIN wallet and deposit money therein in order to gain access to HEXAGONIA. Directed at a market of young Don Diablo fans, HEXCOIN presents itself as an accessible and easily to use alternative to credit and debit transactions.

“As a creator of electronic music, I’ve always been engaged in technology and how it can connect my art to the outside world,” Diablo said. “With HEXCOIN and HEXAGONIA, I see a future where the line between fan, artist, and technology blurs, and creativity is unleashed in powerful, measurable ways. I’m extremely excited to welcome Hexagonians and future fans to the next level of technology in music.”"

"Here's the from DN Journal, to fill you in on the latest buzz going around the domain name industry.  The Lowdown is compiled by DN Journal Editor & Publisher Ron Jackson. Crypto.com Owner Says Stop Calling! No Interest in Multi-Million $ Offers and No Fan of Cryptocurrencies A very interesting new article about the Crypto.com domain name and its owner, written by Adrianne Jeffries, was published at today. I found out about it when Adrianne contacted me shortly before publishing the piece to get some background on current market conditions for cryptocurrency related domain names. As you all know they have become very popular with some selling for millions of dollars (like ETH.com for $2 million last fall).  Matt Blaze, an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a leading expert on cryptography (he has a Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton and over 41,000 followers on ), happens to own what may be the best domain in the entire category in Crypto.com. With the boom in cryptocurrencies Blaze has been besieged by people trying to buy the domain from him and he is not happy about it -  especially since he insists the name is not for sale at any price - and especially not to anyone who would use it for cryptocurrency purposes. Blaze even has a warning notice on stating ""Many cryptocurrencies are scams, and I strongly advise against their use as investment vehicles."" Blaze also bemoans how the cryptocurrency frenzy has muddied the original meaning of ""crypto"" which is the root of the information security science of cryptography - his specialty. Blaze wrote on Twitter, “I think calling cryptocurrencies ‘crypto’ is a poor choice, with bad consequences for both cryptography and cryptocurrencies. That doesn’t mean I’m some kind of language prescriptivist, and your saying that ‘language evolves’ or other such prattle doesn’t invalidate my concerns.”  As hard as it may to be imagine someone saying no thank you to a multi-million dollar payday, I have no doubt Blaze is sincere. In academic circles there are a lot of brilliant people for whom money is not at the top of their priority list (my daughter happens to be a UPenn graduate so I  had the pleasure of meeting many of them on the same campus where Blaze now works). So, despite the old adage that ""it never hurts to try,"" it probably is a waste of time where Crypto.com is concerned. It will not be a waste of your time to read Adrianne's fascinating though!  To refer others to  the post above only  (and not the full Lowdown column) you can use this URL:

"Ripple, the blockchain payments company, is gearing up to invest in startups and technology firms that create more uses for its cryptocurrency XRP.

In an interview with TechCrunch on the sidelines of Money2020, the payments conference currently being held in Singapore, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said the company is focused on enabling banks to use its blockchain software offering, while also looking to invest in startups that could provide alternative uses for XRP.

“We, Ripple, will stay focused on solving that institutional use case, but we would certainly partner with companies that are looking to use XRP in lots of different ways,” said Garlinghouse, pointing to Omni, a San Francisco-based startup that provides storage and rental services through XRP. TechCrunch noted that Ripple and two executives from the company were the lead investors in Omni back in January.

“You should expect that you’ll see more of those,” Garlinghouse said. Using XRP for marketplaces and micropayments would be a different focus for the digital token, which is typically aimed at banks and financial firms. However, whether or not XRP is successful for alternative uses depends on if it finds the right partners to give the cryptocurrency justification for its value. As it stands, TechCrunch argued, XRP is still only an asset that validation for its current worth.

The commentary out of Garlinghouse about the potential for future startup acquisitions comes after Ripple announced earlier this month that it has created a new payment app in which transactions are settled instantly. According to news from CNBC at the time, the new app was created with a group of 61 banks in Japan. Dubbed Money Tap, the mobile app will launch in the fall and will be initially offered through SBI Net Sumishin Bank, Suruga Bank and Resona Bank, three of the consortium partners. It will then be rolled out to the remainder of the Japanese banks that are part of the alliance. Ripple said the new app will make it easier for banks to settle payment transactions 24/7. In order to access the new offering, consumers must have a bank account, phone number or a QR barcode."

"Analysis At the Open Source Leadership Summit in Sonoma, California, last week, The Register caught up with Brian Behlendorf, executive director of The Hyperledger Project, and had a chance to chat about the state of open source blockchain technology.

Behlendorf took over the organization in May 2016 after the Linux Foundation announced the project in December 2015. Hyperledger aims to promote the creation of open source code for running distributed ledgers, otherwise known as blockchains.

A blockchain is made up of blocks of data, chained together with cryptographic hashes and distributed across multiple nodes. It's a sort of shared database that can be verified to prevent tampering.

Bitcoin is the most high profile use of blockchain technology but the strong association between the popular cryptocurrency and its technical underpinnings poses an image problem. The prevalence of fraud in the cryptocurrency world invites doubt about blockchain technology in general. Hence the need for some evangelization.

Back in 2015, Behlendorf said, when Hyperledger had just been established, he was concerned that the proof-of-work algorithm and the CPU burn that goes along with it would become problems for Bitcoin. But he felt that blockchain technology could help address the growing centralization of the internet.

""As the world had gotten more digitized, it had gotten more centralized,"" he said. ""When I saw the Hyperledger announcement, it resonated with me that there are other ways to do it. There are other consensus mechanisms that proof-of-work.""

Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism, through which new coins are created, demands calculations that are difficult to produce but easy to verify. Hence Bitcoin miners need massive computing power to generate the cryptocurrency, which gets tracked through its decentralized blockchain network.

Proof-of-work matters when you have anonymous participants in the network; but most of the business world, said Behlendorf, doesn't need that.

Behlendorf believes blockchains will play a prominent role in a growing number of legitimate business activities that have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies.

""At first, when I saw the Hyperledger announcement, I thought it was the old guard trying to be cool again,"" he said, likening the situation to a middle-age man showing up at a skateboard park, with elbow-pads and knee-pads bought on Amazon, saying, ""Hey kids, hold my beer.""

But, Behlendorf said, the companies involved, including IBM and Intel among others, weren't quite so clueless and in the almost two years since he started running the organization, Hyperledger now has two projects – Fabric and Sawtooth - that are available as production-ready releases.

""Having two frameworks out there for some has been confusing,"" he said. ""But we have MySQL and Cassandra. We have Linux-based and iOS-based phones. There's more than one way to slice an egg. Right now, it's this Cambrian explosion kind of moment where it's worth mapping the landscape rather than being Teutonic about it.""

Behlendorf expects a consolidation event at some point, but right now is more concerned about exploring the technological possibilities.

In addition to its two production-ready blockchain frameworks, Hyperledger has taken seven other initiatives (distributed ledger frameworks and tools) under its wing, ranging from an implementation of the Ethereum smart contract engine (Burrow) to a distributed digital identity system (Indy) to an interoperability platform for doing transactions across ledgers (Quilt).

The organization's initial supporters, a group of 30 organizations, has meanwhile ballooned into more than 190 companies, nonprofits, schools and government agencies. About of quarter of the project's members are in mainland China.

As a indicator of interest in Hyperledger tech, Behlendorf pointed to an online blockchain course on edX that has attracted some 75,000 to register. ""That says to me there's a tremendous appetite for people to upskill in this space,"" he said.

Companies, said Behlendorf, are moving more cautiously, piloting the technology but not jumping in all at once.

""These are the kinds of projects that, because they tend to be at the heart of transaction systems, aren't like a blog,"" he explained. ""They're not something you'd just add and then tear back down.""

But there are live examples running in production. Behlendorf pointed to Everledger, which uses Hyperledger Fabric to track diamonds through the supply chain. ""That's already caught millions of dollars of attempted fraud,"" he said.

Also, he said, IBM is using the technology in an internal product financing chain with suppliers that they claim has created $60 million in value. And CLS Bank plans to go live this year with an forex trading platform built on Hyperledger Fabric.

""This isn't the kind of thing like Wordpress where there's going to be suddenly 10,000 deployments in a few months,"" he said. ""But there are I bet 10,000 engineers with their hands right now taking Fabric or Sawtooth or Indy through their paces.""

Behlendorf said one of the important tasks for Hyperledger is to demystify the technology. ""People are told about these machines solving complex mathematical problems when all they're doing is like guessing things and running SHA-256 against it, which is not a big deal. In our system, it's really a distributed database that anybody can write to.""

The magic, he says, comes from the consensus mechanisms – Byzantine fault tolerance, Raft consensus mechanism, or proof of elapsed time. ""These are tools to help guarantee the integrity of the system, but also to ensure that individuals can't frontrun other transactions,"" he explained, noting that techniques for dealing with issues like network latency – which can mess up a distributed database – still have to be refined.

Another important task is making the technology more approachable through tutorials and outreach, to help ease the path to corporate adoption.

What's the technology good for? ""Any integration challenge where there's enough complexity that arises from correlating the efforts of multiple partners,"" said Behlendorf, who argues that distributed ledgers can help wean the world from the centralized hub-and-spoke model where some large entity serves as the intermediary between two parties involved in a transaction.

He points to a project being developed in the Philippines that involves the six largest banks there. When completed, he said, it will allow customers to move their data – transactions, credit histories, and the like – between institutions, control how it gets shared, and even remove their data from a bank if, say, a loan application has been denied.

Behlendorf contends blockchain technology will shake up how business transactions are done, particularly in the finance and healthcare sectors.

""I think [IBM CEO] Ginni Rometty to her credit got it right when she said what the internet was to information, blockchain technology will be to transactions, in terms of making them really cheap to record, and easy to verify,"" he said.

For some companies, that will mean re-thinking their value proposition.

""Anybody who is in the business of being a gateway to information when the internet arose had to reinvent their business,"" said Behlendorf. ""Likewise anybody in the business today of recording transactions and being that trusted third-party at the center will have to reinvent their business, especially those in escrow."" ®"

"An Australian legal tech provider will launch a blockchain-enabled legal charity which it says will allow social justice initiatives to be crowdfunded by way of tax-deductible donations.

Legaler will soon be launching Legaler Aid, a new project it says will have major implications for global access to justice.

Speaking to Lawyers Weekly about the new service, Legaler chief executive Stevie Ghiassi said the aim is to have a “fully transparent and automated charitable entity”, which will “connect lawyers with those at a disadvantage”.

“There are over 4 billion people in the world without access to justice and the rule of law. Our mission is to break that paradigm,” he said.

“If a transparent technologically empowered platform allows people to give donations and see what their funds do, it will enhance trust in charities again and therefore increase donations directly to legal cases.”

There are a lot of lawyers, both in Australia and abroad, he said, that are being underutilised.

“Using tech as a medium and intermediary, we are able to allow competitiveness in that lawyers give proposals for their work through an open, transparent market,” he explained.

Disadvantaged persons can post ‘jobs’ via legal clinics that will work as clearing houses of eligibility, which will be funded by donations and taken up by lawyers who successfully bid for the work.

Being able to better track whatever pro bono work is being done by individual lawyers will, Mr Ghiassi noted, be a useful metric for big law firms that might have difficulty tracking how much such work is being done by their staff.

The aid platform, and currency, will initially be available in Australia, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Investment from private backers is currently being explored, Mr Ghiassi said, with the legal aid platform, especially having “lit a fire under the big firms”.

“The offerings will help [lawyers] find work they are passionate about, connect them to people and causes they care about, and make legal fees more competitive than ever,” he concluded.

Legaler also recently announced it is creating a cryptocurrency for the legal industry to be used by both lawyers and clients for transactions.

The cryptocurrency will be available via an “Initial Coin Offering”, being hosted in June, through which the tech company is hoping to raise $35 million.

Using the online currency, lawyers will be able to earn and spend Legaler tokens within the online ecosystem on features and services such as its referral network, CLE marketplace, and setting rewards for code reviews to ensure due diligence."
"Amid recent bans imposed by China, Neo has the potential to emerge as the cryptocurrency of choice in the heavily regulated nation, and perhaps across the globe. (For more, see China Intensifies Crackdown On Bitcoin Mining.)

Since its inception, Neo’s Onchain technology was designed to be regulator-friendly with a centralized approach that is quite different from most other cryptocurrencies.

This article explains the technology behind Neo and Onchain, their relationship, how they differ from standard blockchain technology, and what potential synergies and opportunities lay ahead, including the rumor that they may yet win acceptance by the Chinese government.

Neo was originally founded as ""AntShares"" by Da Hongfei and Erik Zhan in China in 2014, and was rebranded ""Neo"" in June 2017. It is a blockchain-based platform that supports its own cryptocurrency and enables development of digital assets and smart contracts.

Neo aims to automate the management of digital assets through the use of smart contracts, with an eventual aim of building a distributed network-based smart economy system. (For more, see Are Smart Contracts the Best of Blockchain?)

Assets can be easily digitized on the Neo blockchain in an open, decentralized, trustworthy, traceable, and transparent manner that is free of intermediaries and associated costs.

Users are able to record, buy, sell, exchange, or circulate various kinds of assets, as Neo provides the necessary platform for linking the physical asset with an equivalent and unique digital avatar on its network. Neo also supports protection of assets, as assets registered on its platform through a validated digital identity are “protected by law.”

Digital identity enables verifiable key information about participating individuals, organizations, and other entities that exist in digital context.

Smart contracts enable the execution of transactions and agreements among different parties without the governance by any legal system or central mechanism. The execution of such contracts is based on the programming code of the network, and it allows traceability, transparency and irreversibility of the transactions.

Neo supports two cryptocoins, NEO and GAS. It supports programming in all mainstream languages including C#, Java, Go, Python and Kotlin, which enables a large community of developers to easily contribute to its platform.

Neo maintains a clear distinction from other standard blockchain platforms, as its focus remains on being regulatory-compliant. While digitized assets and smart contracts are also popular on other blockchain platforms like Ethereum, the third key feature of “Digital Identity” separates Neo from the rest.

Every individual, business, or any other entity operating on the Neo platform is expected to have a unique digital identity that will be verifiable. People, businesses, and projects have the option to transact among themselves only if the other party has the required identity, which makes the Neo network regulatory-compliant.

Even the various nodes on the Neo network may need to have identification before they can contribute to the transaction verification and other activities like accounting and bookkeeping.

While working on Neo, the cryptocurrency's founders, Da Hongfei and Erik Zhan, received interest from various enterprises looking for private blockchain solutions. Thus emerged Onchain in 2014, an independent technology company that works with the necessary financial and legal frameworks and provides blockchain solutions to various enterprises.

While Neo works like bitcoin and ethereum, Onchain focuses on the creation of private and consortium blockchains to meet the specific needs of the industry.

Onchain’s major product, Distributed Networks Architecture (DNA), uses digital asset applications to help businesses by creating private and public blockchains. DNA is believed to be the blockchain platform that can be customized to address all sorts of different problems in the private and public sectors.

Neo and Onchain are two separate entities that exist independently, and neither owns the other. Neo targets the B2C segment, where C can refer to customer or even community, while Onchain focuses on B2B enterprise services.

Both are separately funded. Neo is funded by a public community, while Onchain is backed by China’s largest private conglomerate called Fosun.

When asked why he chose Fosun as an investment partner, founder Da Hongfei said:“The three major arms of their (Fosun’s) portfolio include finance, medical science, entertainment and lifestyle, which has good synergy with blockchain tech. This is why we chose Fosun Group as an investment partner, because we highly value the Enterprise resource that Fosun provide, a platform for Onchain to display blockchain technology.”

The two common founders of both companies, Neo and Onchain, envision that in the future, they will be able to achieve cross-chain interoperability. That is, a mechanism will be developed where the necessary connections to share information between the various blockchains, such as public ones like Neo, and private ones, like those operated by a business, will become possible.

As the number of blockchain-based systems continues to grow in both the public and private domains, there will eventually be a need to have interoperability among various blockchains. The teams at Neo and Onchain expect to fill this gap through their ongoing work.

However, to enable such interoperability, trust and identity become important. That gap will be filled by the intrinsic “Digital Identity” feature which is an integral part of the Neo blockchain platform.

Essentially, Neo and Onchain may pave the much-needed middle path between the completely decentralized, unregulated, anonymous blockchain system like bitcoin, and the completely regulated, KYC-compliant economy like the present-day system of bank accounts and credit cards.

By taking an all-inclusive approach that attempts to involve and serve the needs of all the parties – the individual users, the network contributors like miners, the transacting participants, the private businesses, and even the regulators – Neo and Onchain may be best placed to provide a holistic solution to the ongoing rift between the closed-economy regulators and the open-system cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

The Neo platform acts as the foundation of Onchain’s DNA concept. Neo provides decentralized, public blockchains while OnChain’s DNA fills the need for private blockchains. Linking both these systems enable one to get the best of both worlds.

Onchain has already received an endorsement for DNA from the government of Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou province of Southwest China. Both parties jointly released smart contract 2.0 and other Chinese blockchain technology in early 2017. In mid-2017, Onchain was among the first batch of companies that successfully passed the Chinese blockchain test, which was followed by an investment partnership with the Fosun Group.

Despite China tightening its grip on cryptocurrencies recently, the acceptance of blockchain technology is a clear possibility. (For more, see Is Bitcoin Banned in China?)

In mid-2017, the Chinese government was reported to be experimenting and creating its own national cryptocurrency. (For more, see Chinese Government is Developing its Own Cryptocurrency.)

Despite its hard stance on the various decentralized cryptocurrencies and ICOs, rumors are swirling that the government may be looking for an alternate solution and it remains open to working with companies that are willing to play by its rules. Being local Chinese ventures, Neo and Onchain are the top contenders if this is true.

If the promising Onchain technology can be accepted and integrated with the Chinese government and businesses enabling an all-inclusive solution, then it will greatly increase the widespread adoption of Neo.

The technical robustness of the Neo-Onchain concept and its centralized approach looks promising, making it an attractive option not just for Chinese authorities, but for other foreign governments that are wary of the anonymous and decentralized virtual currency market.

"Cryptocurrency forks of various types now take place on a regular basis. Even bitcoin has experienced several different iterations and branches in this way. One of the largest and most discussed bitcoin forks took place late in 2017.

Bitcoin gold was a hard fork of the original open source cryptocurrency which took place on October 24, 2017. While hard forks take place for a number of reasons – including for the purposes of scaling as a cryptocurrency customer base grows, or because of developer conflict and differences of goals – bitcoin gold's stated purpose has been to ""make bitcoin decentralized again.""

On the surface, the idea of ""making bitcoin decentralized again"" may seem counterintuitive. Bitcoin, like all other cryptocurrencies, is designed to be decentralized already; it is not linked with any central bank, particularly country, or government body.

One of the major issues with bitcoin which prompted the development of bitcoin gold, however, was not related to the question of central issuance at all. Rather, it had to do with the mining process. Bitcoin gold developers believed that by adopting a new algorithm for the mining process (in this case, a so-called proof-of-work algorithm called Equihash), the new branch of the world's most popular cryptocurrency by market cap would not disproportionally favor major mining operations.

Bitcoin mining is a lucrative but resource-intensive process. The most profitable mining ventures are often those which pool together a large number of mining rigs, each of which requires expensive, special equipment. (See more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?)

Individuals attempting to mine for bitcoin on their own either have to invest a huge amount of money and time into creating their own rigs, or they get passed by in the process, as their computers are unable to compete with the professional rig systems.

One of the primary goals of bitcoin gold has been to change the algorithm by which the cryptocurrency itself is mined, meaning that the mining process cannot be run faster on specialized equipment than it can on standard computer systems.

Bitcoin gold was not the first major hard fork of bitcoin. Bitcoin cash forked off from the primary cryptocurrency in August of 2017.

In 2018, bitcoin is anticipating several additional hard forks, prompting some to speculate that there may be diminishing returns in terms of investor interest as more offshoots of bitcoin reach the market. (See more: Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash: What's the Difference?)

Besides the goal of ""re-decentralizing"" bitcoin, bitcoin gold's developers were also focused on issues relating to distribution, protection, and transparency. ""Hard forking bitcoin's blockchain fairly and efficiently distributes a new digital asset immediately to people all over the world who have interest in cryptocoins,"" the bitcoin gold website states.

In the world of virtual currencies, threats from hackers and other malicious entities are constantly a concern. For that reason, bitcoin gold took additional safety and protective measures from the time of its launch, in an effort to help secure its customers' accounts and coins. These include replay protection and unique wallet addresses. (See also: Can Bitcoin Be Hacked?)

The fact that bitcoin gold is ""a free open-source software project that is built by volunteer developers and supported by a rapidly growing community of bitcoin enthusiasts that stretches around the globe"" is also a draw for potential customers.

For all cryptocurrencies, one of the major factors which helps to determine both short-term and long-term success is its availability on cryptocurrency exchanges. Users must be able to access the cryptocurrency on exchanges in order to make transactions.

According to the bitcoin gold website, as of March 2018, the cryptocurrency was trading live on Bithumb, Bitfinex, Binance, Bittrex, HitBTC, Uphold, YoBit, Gate.io, Changelly, Shapeshift, BitBay, Abucoins, Change Now, Evercoin, Tdax, Bitsane, Bitstarex, QuadrigaCX, Cex.io, Okex, Anybits, BestRate, Bitmarket, Indacoin, CoinSwitch, and Unocoin.

There are additional exchanges slated to offer bitcoin gold in the near future as well. The cryptocurrency is also available through a number of wallet services, including Trezor Wallet, Ledger Wallet, Exodus, Coinomi, Bitpie, Guarda, Freewallet, BTGWallet, and Kasse. According to the website, the cryptocurrency has been listed on 46 markets and 26 exchanges as of January, 2018.

The developers of bitcoin gold used what is called ""post-mine"" after the launch. This was the retroactive mining of 100,000 coins after the fork already took place. The way that this happened was through the rapid mining of about 8,000 blocks, the results of which were set aside as an ""endowment"" of sorts, to be used to grow and maintain the broader bitcoin gold network.

About 5% of those 100,000 coins were set aside for each of the six primary team members as a bonus. At the time of the launch, all bitcoin owners received bitcoin gold coins at the rate of one bitcoin gold token per one bitcoin token.

Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, was notably skeptical of bitcoin gold at launch time. Coinbase representatives stated that the exchange ""cannot support bitcoin gold because its developers have not made the code available to the public for review. This is a major security risk."" (See also: Coinbase Hit with 2 Lawsuits: Accused of Insider Bitcoin Cash Trading.)

As of March 4, 2018, bitcoin gold has 253 reachable nodes. The highest concentration of nodes is in Germany (46 nodes), with the next-highest levels being the United States (38), France (37), and Russia (18).

In February 2018, bitcoin gold launched the bitcoin gold insight explorer, calling it a ""fully functional bitcoin gold insight instance and web application service presenting the Insight UI and Insight API.""

Like most cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gold has had its share of detractors and controversies. Just days after the launch, miners accused one of the developers of bitcoin gold of having added in a 0.5% mining fee that was hidden from the mining community.

According to the bitcoin gold website, the cryptocurrency maintains ambitious plans for expansion into the future. In the first quarter of 2018, for instance, the website says its goals including ""open source libraries integration"" with BitcoinJS, BitcoinJ, and CoPay, as well as ""academic and university collaboration"" and ""design and rebranding,"" including a refreshed website.

In the second quarter of 2018, the digital currency aims to integrate a lightning network and decentralized mining through P2Pool. There is also a plan to integrate a debit card program and other payment systems integrations.

By the end of 2018, the cryptocurrency aims to develop ""sidechains and cross-chain atomic swaps"" as well as a number of meet-ups and developer conferences, university outreach, and more. Looking ahead to 2019, the cryptocurrency has its sights on private transactions and scholarship or research support.

Over the longer term, bitcoin gold will conduct research on smart contracts and blockchain democracy, as well as develop a decentralized fiat-crypto brokerage network. (See also: How Did Bitcoin Gold Prices Perform in 2017?)

Bitcoin gold developers are conscious of the connections between this cryptocurrency, its parent bitcoin, and the broader digital currency world. As such, they indicate that ""the core improvements we're working on are all of great interest in the broader bitcoin and crypto worlds, not merely for bitcoin gold."" They said some of these unilaterally applicable improvements may include scalable ways to address hard forks, ""smart voting mechanisms,"" and decentralized decision-making for the development of the digital currency.

"Japan Wants to See G20 Counterparts Increasing Efforts to Stop Cryptocurrency in Money Laundering

Japan is expected to urge its G20 peers to step up efforts to prevent cryptocurrencies being used in money laundering, according to a government official.

In a report from Reuters, it’s unlikely that finance leaders in G20 nations will be able to agree on set rules, given the fact that each country has a different approach to the market.

China, for instance, banned the use of cryptocurrency trading last September and is taking steps to outlaw citizens from accessing foreign crypto websites. Whereas, Saudi Arabia appears to be taking a more laissez faire-approach to the space as it continues to watch market developments.

An official involved in the G20 talks said:

This move from Japanese policymakers could be in response to the hack at Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck at the end of January. Believed to be down to a lack of proper security measures, thieves were able to steal 523 million NEM units, worth around $530 million, and making it the biggest hack of its kind.

As a result, the country’s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), issued the exchange with improvement orders. This eventually led to a month-long suspension at two digital currency exchanges after it was discovered that they were lacking the correct procedures.

Notably, this has put the limelight on the country considering it was the first to adopt a national system that would oversee digital currency trading. Coincheck completed its vow to reimburse 260,000 of its customers who lost holdings of NEM today.

Despite the fact that each country looks at the market differently, France and Germany are expected to make a joint proposal at the G20 summit next week to regulate bitcoin.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in January, of the proposal, that:

According to Japanese officials, regulations need to be applied that protect consumers and prevent illegal activities while ensuring that innovation isn’t being stifled in the sector."
"As global cryptocurrency markets continue to slide from elusive January highs, it’s becoming increasingly evident that the next “boom” may be further away than many had anticipated. Bitcoin’s price is down nearly 50% from its local January 7 high of US$17,000, and other altcoins have seen average losses of about 60% in that same time frame.

While these numbers are not encouraging indicators, what may be even more significant is the change in trading volume between then and now. Days before the January 7 high, the global trading volume of all cryptocurrencies reached a record US$71.6 billion. In the past few days, 24-hour volume has fluctuated around $15 billion. This drop-off represents an almost 80% reduction in trading activity.

This massive loss of volume suggests two realities. The first is that active traders, who may have accrued massive profits during the bull market, were shaken out due to significant losses and/or newfound patience. It’s no secret that inexperienced or otherwise unsuccessful day traders can take the biggest hits in turbulent markets, and the volume loss indicates that some of these frequent contributors saw crippling blows to their positions. This, of course, is natural, and while it’s not a generally positive influence on markets, it’s nothing to get too concerned with.

The second, much more serious reality is that general interest and conversation about cryptocurrency is down. All the new investors who found out about this great new technology over the holidays are no longer looking to purchase Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s likely that they, too, have largely been shaken out with the extended downtrend. Google Trends supports this conclusion. Bitcoin saw its largest interest at its all-time high value of US$20,000 in December, and has since seen a drop in search interest of 80%. The term “cryptocurrency” has fared slightly better, but peak interest at the time of the global January 7 high was still 4 times what it is now, which equates to a similarly massive drop in interest of 75%.

General search interest has fallen to the same level as was seen in late October, when the global cryptocurrency market cap was less than half of what it is now. If the relationship between volume and price movements holds true – that is, if volume falls at a rate greater than value does, this does not necessarily suggest coins will similarly drop back to pre-November prices. However, it still suggests that unless interest sees a trend reversal, the bear market could potentially continue for quite some time."

"How many central banks are actually considering their own version of cryptocurrency is unclear, Russia and Venezuela being the most infamous examples. To perhaps ward off serious consideration from more established economies, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the world’s central bank to central bankers, is suggesting state-backed crypto might destabilize commercial banks’ customer deposits, negatively impacting the “efficiency of financial intermediation.”

Also read: Québec Premier: We’re Not Really Interested in Bitcoin Mining

Chairs of two BIS working groups, Klaus Löber (European Central Bank) and Aerdt Houben (Netherlands Bank), submitted Central Bank Digital Currencies, a 34-page document meant to be a “high-level overview of [central bank digital currency (CBDC)] implications for payments, monetary policy and financial stability. The analysis of the committees reflects initial thinking in this rapidly evolving area and is a starting point for further discussion and research. It also highlights that the issuance of a CBDC requires careful consideration,” it outlines in the Foreword.

The word, “careful,” in one form or another, is sprinkled half a dozen times throughout, as in “Any steps towards the possible launch of a CBDC should be subject to careful and thorough consideration. Further research on the possible effects on interest rates, the structure of intermediation, financial stability and financial supervision is warranted. The effects on movements in exchange rates and other asset prices remain largely unknown and also deserve further exploration.”

The BIS has been particularly vocal of late on the subject of crypto, as when last month its General Manager stressed “while perhaps intended as an alternative payment system with no government involvement, it has become a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.” The 87 year old, Basel, Switzerland-based central bank is the world’s lender of last resort to the lenders of last resort.

The report is revealing in the sense it appears cryptocurrency is an increasingly important topic of conversation, and that at least some central banks are considering competing alternatives as perhaps an answer. Where last month’s BIS comments dismissed crypto, the present report doesn’t outright condemn a state-backed coin. The paper “finds that wholesale CBDCs might be useful for payments but more work is needed to assess the full potential. Although a CBDC would not alter the basic mechanics of monetary policy implementation, its transmission could be affected.”

“Many forms of CBDC are possible,” the report emphasizes, “with different implications for payment systems, monetary policy transmission as well as the structure and stability of the financial system. Two main CBDC variants are analysed in this report: a wholesale and a general purpose one. The wholesale variant would limit access to a predefined group of users, while the general purpose one would be widely accessible.”

By contrast, “A general purpose CBDC could have wide-ranging implications for banks and the financial system. Commercial banks’ reliance on customer deposits may become less stable, as deposits could more easily take flight to the central bank in times of stress. Besides consequences for financial stability, effects on the efficiency of financial intermediation need to be carefully considered,” the authors detailed.

To buttress the wholesale point, the report continues to argue, “Wholesale CBDCs, combined with the use of distributed ledger technology, may enhance settlement efficiency for transactions involving securities and derivatives. Currently proposed implementations for wholesale payments – designed to comply with existing central bank system requirements relating to capacity, efficiency and robustness – look broadly similar to, and not clearly superior to, existing infrastructures. While future proofs of concept may rely on different system designs, more experimentation and experience would be required before central banks can usefully and safely implement new technologies supporting a wholesale CBDC variant.”

Again, this is all very revealing. Too much “general purpose” crypto, even state backed, would destabilize economies, but that doesn’t mean more obviously efficient aspects of the technology shouldn’t be employed as a settlement layer behind the scenes, central bank to central bank. Of course, the BIS loves blockchain technology, and so far the only developed economy seriously flirting with some kind of central bank cryptocurrency is Sweden’s Riksbank (its study for the “e-krona” won’t be ready until next year).

"Just after offering up a bounty to track down the hackers who attacked it, cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced the launch of a public blockchain.

Binance Chain, as it is known, is the exchange's vision of the future, and it will focus mainly on the transfer and trading of blockchain assets. Binance also announced that its own Binance Coin (BNB) will become a native coin, changing from the current Ethereum-based ERC20 token.

The move is part of a drive to support and improve the cryptocurrency industry, something Binance says it has already started through its blockchain technology incubator Binance Labs and its Binance Info codex. Reaction to the announcement about Binance Chain was positive on Twitter:

After extensively researching decentralized exchange frameworks and analyzing existing implementations, we believe significant improvements can be made in providing Binance users with a level of trading experience to which they are already accustomed. Centralized and Decentralized exchanges will co-exist in the near future, complementing each other, while also having interdependence. We stand here today because we believe that Blockchain technology will change the world. In the face of adversity, we have always elected to tackle issues head-on, instead of retreating. As such, we have decided to officially launch the development of the Binance Chain.

The exchange goes on to say:

As a public blockchain, Binance Chain will mainly focus on the transfer and trading of blockchain assets, as well as provide new possibilities for the future flow of blockchain assets. Binance Chain will focus on performance, ease-of-use, and liquidity. Binance Coin (BNB) will be upgraded to exist on its own blockchain mainnet, becoming a native coin. At the same time, Binance will transition from being a company to a community.

Following news from Binance, its BNB token shot up in value by over 20 percent."

"DasCoin, also known as the Currency of Trust, is building trust in the crypto community through their responsive and transparent system of governance. What other qualities should you look for before you put your trust in a cryptocurrency?

Ways to Determine If a Cryptocurrency can be Trusted

Technology is fast-evolving and fast-moving, and the people who are dependent on the Internet want to know the best ways to make the most of their time and money online. The many methods of creating an income and livelihoods have come with the price of not knowing each method’s authenticity or legality as easily as you would when you walk into a physical shop.

The onset of the digital age has allowed individuals to make money in a variety of ways, from creating websites and selling in online shops,to working at the comfort of one’s own home and investing in cryptocurrency. While some methods are trusted and proven, a lot of popular options have already saturated the markets and their value tends to decrease over time.

Trading is one of the many ways to invest your hard-earned money. In recent trends, your money could easily grow to over five times its value with cryptocurrency. However, it’s not all good and safe since cryptocurrency is a very volatile market. Aside from that, there have been new reports and controversies surrounding certain coins and their companies.

A person who has only recently been exposed to the world of cryptocurrency would wonder about all the coins, apart from the popular ones like Bitcoin. With choices like DasCoin, Ethereum, and NEO, how does a new consumer find out whether a cryptocurrency is worth buying?

There is a saying that you should only invest money that you’re not afraid to lose, and that’s true for the most part. The reason behind that quote is the fact that investments take time to manifest. While some ventures guarantee an immediate return of investments, others take more time.

Aside from time, the reason why a person should only put extra money in any venture is because there is no guarantee that you will be able to make profit off of your venture. The probability that you won’t get back or make money off of your investments is one of the reasons why emergency funds should just be kept where they are and not put into online investments.https://netleaders.com/en/

Your money is one of your most valuable resources, so it’s important to put your cash into something that is reliable and trustworthy. DasCoinis known as the Currency of Trust, and it is one of the hundreds of currencies that are clamouring for your trust and money.

The best way to determine if a cryptocurrency,like DasCoin,is trustworthy is to check out its whitepaper and documentation. A trusted company will have its paperwork and processes in order and will not be afraid to show their clients what they can do and what they are planning to do in the future.

 Aside from checking the paperwork, you can also learn a lot from the reviews of the people who have worked with them and those who have been their client for a while. It’s important to know about the companies you’re investing in before you do transactions with them. The key is also taking the time to do your research beforehand."
"Twins who made a fortune in cryptocurrency after settling a claim they came up the idea for Facebook on Tuesday pitched a plan to regulate the wild digital money market.

A virtual currency policing body proposed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss was welcomed by US Commodity Futures Trading Commission member Brian Quintenz.

""We believe adding an additional layer of oversight on virtual commodity cash markets, in the form of self-regulation, is important for consumer protection and to ensure the integrity of these markets,"" Cameron Winklevoss said in online post.

The brothers, who established and operate Gemini bitcoin exchange in New York City, proposed an industry-sponsored virtual commodity association to establish and police cryptocurrency standards.

The Winklevoss twins contended that the creation of an independent regulatory body is the ""next logical step in the maturation of this market.""

The British government early this year called for global regulation of controversial virtual currency bitcoin, adding that the G20 would address the topic this month.

Bitcoin is independent of governments and banks and uses blockchain technology, where encrypted digital coins are created by supercomputers.

The virtual currency is not regulated by any central bank but is instead overseen by a community of users who try to guard against counterfeiting.

Virtual currency exchanges have seen tremendous volatility, and have sparked concerns they can be used to launder money for criminal networks.

Trading of digital currency in the US is regulated as a commodity, such as corn or oil.

Quintenz congratulated the Winklevoss brothers for ""their energetic leadership and thoughtful approach"" to the idea of a regulatory body.

""A virtual commodity SRO that has the most independence from its membership, the most diversity of views, and the strongest ability to discover, reveal, and punish wrongdoing will add the most integrity to these markets,"" Quintenz said in a statement.

The Winklevoss twins are part of the story of Facebook's controversial genesis story.

In 2008, a $65 million settlement was reached with three Harvard classmates -- twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra -- over their charges that Mark Zuckerberg had stolen the idea for Facebook from them.

The conflict was at the heart of ""The Social Network,"" the Oscar-winning film written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher."

"But there are some famous folks who really go the extra mile, who become so consumed by their own delusions of grandeur that they transcend mere stupidity and achieve a higher plane. It’s a higher plane of idiocy, but still.

Making fun of famous people is what we do best here at Celebrity Slam. That delightful combination of constant scrutiny and rampant egoism that is inherent to pretty much all celebrities? Well, it’s essentially a perfect storm that lends itself to the saying and doing of hilariously stupid things.

There are a lot of things we COULD talk about with Mr. Seagal. His seemingly unending stream of poorly-produced hack action movies or his assistance in advertising for a Russian arms manufacturer and friendliness with one Vladimir Putin, maybe? Or the numerous accusations of sexual misconduct levied against him? Or maybe his endorsement of a shady cryptocurrency?

Yeah – we’re going to go ahead and do that last one.

Seagal made news last month by endorsing a new cryptocurrency called Bitcoiin2Gen. But last week, said cryptocurrency wound up in legal trouble, with the state of New Jersey’s Bureau of Securities issuing a cease-and-desist order against the company’s initial coin offering. Yes, it’s an order that only applies to operations in New Jersey, but it’s still not a great look.

And it won’t be the least, because this whole thing definitely smells even scammier than a lot of these questionable cryptocurrency outfits.

Leaving aside the general shadiness of the name, which is clearly intended to piggyback off the prominence of leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin – the extra “i” is for “it’s totally not a scam” – this is precisely the sort of thing that reminds us all of what a lunatic weirdo Seagal has become in recent years.

He obviously doesn’t care about his reputation any more – watch any movie he’s made in the last decade for proof of that – but this is shady even for him. When the company you’re endorsing begins their press release by telling people that they are totally not a pyramid scheme, it should maybe raise an alarm bell or two. They literally say they aren’t scamming people. Generally, when you need to say that, you’re almost certainly scamming people.

It’s pretty clear that this Bitcoiin2Gen isn’t actually FOR anything. And while the company’s website does feature a disclaimer that states that Seagal doesn’t have any sort of ownership stake in the company … are we really supposed to believe that? What other compensation could they have possibly given him? Sure, he probably works for kimonos and chicken wings at this point, but those things still cost money at some point along the line.

Also, can we talk about the baseline weirdness of this whole thing? If you’d told us even a couple of years ago that we’d be talking about a decentralized currency endorsed by Steven Seagal getting shut down from trading in New Jersey, we’d have asked you if you were drunk or if you had hit your head. Instead, that’s the world we live in.

Or scariest of all - what if Steven Seagal is actually some sort of cryptocurrency savant? What if he has taken his aikido-honed sense of using one’s physical forces against them and turned it toward market forces? What if he’s actually playing us all?

We can see it now – Steven Seagal’s “Crypto-Kill,” coming soon to VOD and streaming services. He’ll decentralize you … straight to hell."
"Blockchain was just a buzzword a few years ago but today, it is going mainstream. As a result, companies are beginning to take up space in the cryptocurrency industry.



Amazon (AMZN Trade) and Starbucks (SBUX Trade) are trailblazing the entry of corporates to the cryptocurrency market - if their recent announcement to create their own virtual currencies and integrate blockchain in their business models is anything to go by.

The two now join other giant, forward-thinking, successful companies, like Microsoft (MSFT Trade), IBM (IBM Trade), Walmart (WMT Trade), British Airways, Everledger and Maersk, which are already using blockchain.

These companies are using blockchain technology to reduce risks associated with information tampering, facilitating easy storage, sharing of data between stakeholders and running businesses more securely and efficiently.

“This has been expected but it is great to hear that these developments are starting to materialize. I think they will have a very positive impact on marketing and the sentiment towards it,” says Nikolaj Martyniuk, CEO and co-founder of WePower.

The blockchain market has largely been impacted by the rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs), increasing demand for cryptocurrencies and increased incorporation of blockchain technology in corporate models.

The industry’s market cap has also increased significantly due to increased investor interest in blockchain investment opportunities. The decision by Amazon and Starbucks to integrate cryptocurrency in their operations will definitely be felt in the crypto market.

These two retailers interact with millions of customers on a daily basis. Amazon has over 310 million active customer accounts globally and Starbucks operates more than 27,000 stores located in 62 countries worldwide. Should the companies adopt blockchain, these customers will become away with cryptocurrencies and get more interested on how the industry works and probably start using cryptocurrencies.

This is likely to have a huge impact on prices, as well as the market cap, of cryptocurrencies. The confidence these customers have in cryptocurrencies will also boost interest in crypto investments.

Linda Butcher, Chief Business Development Officer at Rewards Token says, “Taking crypto mainstream is Rewards.com key message. The more retailers we have that will either take crypto or produce their own token means more global acceptance. It is good for the entire industry.""

There are some parts of the world where the use of cryptocurrency is still in initial stages. This is due to low awareness and legislation issues. With the large customer base of Amazon and Starbucks, and the fact that they interact with customers every day, the acceptance of and confidence in cryptocurrencies is likely to increase.

According to Eran Eyal, CEO and Co-Founder of Shopin, the decision by the two companies to incorporate cryptocurrency or blockchain technology into their businesses will motivate and convince other companies to follow suit.

He says, “Notably many of the companies are moving in this direction, for example there are hints that Facebook is going to be launching an internal cryptocurrency, or the recent announcement from Rakuten’s intention to shift their $9 billion loyalty program into a cryptocurrency. I believe this would enfranchise consumers, as cryptocurrencies are always best when they don’t have a shelf life. Cryptocurrency is also easy to trade and transfer between users for the purposes of gifting. This is an elegant solution for any loyalty program. Coupled with blockchain, this could also lead to decreases errors or fraud.”

Application of blockchain technology has revolutionized the way companies collect, store and share data and information. It has also reduced costs and improved the safety and efficiency of online trade, particularly online shopping and payments.

As such, the decision by Amazon and Starbucks to integrate virtual currencies into their business models is a positive vote that shows acceptance and confidence in the cryptocurrency market. So we should expect more crypto investments in the near future from all parts of the world.

"A proposed cryptocurrency self-regulatory organization (SRO) put forward by Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss has won support from a key government advocate on the issue.

CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz has consistently advocated for the creation of a crypto SRO, calling for such a move during last week's keynote at the DC Blockchain Summit in Washington, D.C.

In a statement released on Tuesday, he congratulated the Winklevosses on their ""thoughtful approach"" to the area, going on to say:

""Ultimately, a virtual commodity SRO that has the most independence from its membership, the most diversity of views, and the strongest ability to discover, reveal, and punish wrongdoing will add the most integrity to these markets. I encourage Gemini (or any other market participant, advocacy group, platform, or firm) to be aggressive in promoting these qualities within any SRO construct.""

As detailed in a new blog post, Gemini's proposed ""Virtual Commodity Association"" would function as a non-profit, independent organization to be governed by a board of directors. It would ""not provide regulatory programs for security tokens or security token platforms"" or function as a trade organization. The Winklevosses wrote that the group would be modeled in part after the National Futures Association, an SRO focused on the derivatives industry.

""We believe adding an additional layer of oversight on virtual commodity cash markets, in the form of self-regulation, is important for consumer protection and to ensure the integrity of these markets,"" they wrote.

Membership will be open to ""virtual commodity platforms"" and over-the-counter (OTC) trading firms, in addition to ""other trading facilities acting as counterparties"" which provide an ""all-to-all platform or venue, available to U.S. participants, for transacting in the spot virtual commodity markets,"" among other types of businesses that service the space.

""We believe a thoughtful SRO framework that provides a virtual commodity regulatory program for the virtual commodity industry is the next logical step in the maturation of this market,"" the Winklevosses concluded. ""We look forward to engaging with industry leaders participants, regulators, and legislators on this proposal.""

"The government institutions or affiliated structures of Egypt broke the Internet connection of the country’s citizens using the ""AdHose"" program, which redirects traffic to Monero mining or shows extra advertisements. This information was published in a report by the explorers of the University of Toronto on Friday.



“We found similar middleboxes at a Telecom Egypt demarcation point. The middleboxes were being used to redirect users across dozens of ISPs to affiliate ads and browser cryptocurrency mining scripts”, - the report claims. 



The financial market still has some suspicions concerning Bitcoin mining as well as other cryptocurrencies, given the fact that such operations are often conducted without users’ consent. Consequently, a bunch of Canadian researchers detected a modality, which might have been used by the Egyptian authorities to mine Monero secretly with the help of their citizens’ computers. This is possibly the result of using a fintech technique that the investigators called AdHose.

Firstly, the researchers started their study with reviewing all of the IP addresses in definite countries to find DPI devices called middleboxes. Such systems catch traffic on Turk Telekom’s network and redirect all users to nation-state spyware while the people just wanted to download some legal Windows applications.

It was mentioned that the financial technology AdHose includes two modes: the spray mode and the trickle mode. The first “redirects Egyptian Internet users en masse to ads or cryptocurrency mining scripts whenever they make a request to any website” and the last “targets some Javascript resources and defunct websites for ad injection.”

Telecom is a major telecommunications company, 80% of which is held by the Egyptian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. And the middleboxes mentioned earlier include Sandvine PacketLogic devices, which have been associated with state surveillance in Turkey and Syria.

The Citizen Lab appealed to Sandvine and Francisco Partners sending their recently found data to them in February. In its reply, Sandvine claimed that the report was “false, misleading, and wrong.” However, the lab stated, “We emphasized that we were confident in our research findings, which two independent peer reviews confirmed.”"

"Are you talking to clients about cryptocurrencies (a.k.a., virtual currencies, or digital currencies)? Even though most taxpayers are not miners, traders, or even users of cryptocurrency, they likely have questions about it -- and some may have engaged in some form of taxable transaction involving cryptocurrency without realizing they have a tax liability.

A cryptocurrency is a digital asset, or currency, that is traded and secured using cryptography, according to Chuck McCabe, president and founder of Peoples Income Tax and The Income Tax School. “You don’t need a bank to trade this currency,” he explained. “You can trade it peer to peer on a decentralized control called blockchain, which is basically a public transaction database that functions as a distributed ledger.”

Anyone can purchase cryptocurrency using a debit or credit card, McCabe noted. “You set up an account, verify your identity, usually with a driver’s license, and you’re good to go,” he said. “Currently, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a gold rush because many of the available currencies have been increasing in value rather rapidly. It is quite likely that one or more of a preparer’s clients have invested in cryptocurrency, which is why preparers should ask about it during tax season appointments this year.”

While it has “currency” in its name, the IRS actually views cryptocurrency as property, which means there could be capital gains implications, according to McCabe.

While the IRS provided guidance in Notice 2014-21 nearly four years ago, it hasn’t revisited the topic since. “And as tax pros, we know that it is better to just disclose than to end up with criminal charges,” McCabe said.

“So, if you have clients selling, spending or even exchanging cryptocurrency for other tokens, they will likely have capital gains implications, and, if they were paid in cryptocurrency, they will have to report that as income.”

The following are taxable actions with regard to cryptocurrency, according to McCabe:

Since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, 3 million people have sent $166 billion in virtual currency payments via the internet for goods or services, or have held the funds for investment, according to Selva Ozelli, CPA, Esq. “Although there are over 800 active virtual currencies listed, Bitcoin is by far the most popular, comprising nearly 80 percent of the entire virtual currency market,” she said. “Bitcoins originally were used in the online gaming industry, but the increasing popularity of virtual currencies allows users to pay for everything, even real estate in a high-end Dubai real estate project, in the same way as fiat currencies. More than 100,000 merchants worldwide now accept them as legal tender.”

The blockchain technology behind cryptocurrency has the potential to change the accounting industry all together, according to McCabe.

“Cryptocurrency is just one application of blockchain technology,” he observed. “Blockchain is a chain of blocks that exist in a database. Each block contains a digital ledger of transactions, with time stamps, that have been hashed and encoded, and a cryptographic hash of the block that came before it. All of these blocks are linked to each other because they contain an encryption from the prior block. This creates a layer of security that prevents people from altering details about the transaction after it has occurred.”"

"Hong Kong-based Binance.com is in the works to debut both its own ?blockchain and an upgraded version of its cryptocurrency – this is according to its official blog. ?

The new blockchain platform will be called ‘Binance Chain’ and according to the company’s statement, it is to be based on an improved ?version of the emerging technology that focuses on performance, ease-of-use, and liquidity.?

Binance was the world’s second-most active crypto exchange over the past 24 hours, ?according to Coinmarketcap.com, hosting $1.47 billion worth of cryptocurrency trades. ?

The Binance Chain will be used to transfer and trading of blockchain ?assets, eliminate administration tasks using smart contract rules and thus, ?speed transaction settlement. ?

The major crypto venue also said it will upgrade its own token Binance Coin ??(BNB), which launched along with the exchange last year, to exist on its public blockchain. ?Binance’s crypto coin, which is an ERC20 token built on Ethereum, has benefited from the exchange’s explosive success and is now ?listed among the top 30 cryptocurrencies in the world by market cap.

The improved version of Binance Coin ??(BNB) is expected to represent the motherboard that serves the entire Binance blockchain, as well as other features that are yet to come. Among other things, BNB is currently used to pay for exchange fees and allow participants to make investments within Binance ecosystem.

With an already existing user base of several millions, the opportunities for ?this Blockchain and cryptocurrency seem enormous.

Binance’s statement further reads: “After extensively researching decentralized exchange frameworks and analyzing existing implementations, we believe significant improvements can be made in providing Binance users with a level of trading experience to which they are already accustomed. Centralized and Decentralized exchanges will co-exist in the near future, complementing each other, while also having interdependence. We stand here today because we believe that Blockchain technology will change the world.?”"
"Switzerland-based cryptocurrency exchange Monaco has opted for Jumio‘s biometric identity verification solution for customer onboarding.

Monaco’s aim is to offer a digital exchange that lets users trade both fiat and cryptocurrencies at perfect interbank exchange rates. As such, the firm is catering to a user base that is particularly interested in doing business on mobile, and so Monaco needs a way to verify user identities that is streamlined for this channel.

Jumio’s solution is thus a natural fit. Leveraging a standard smartphone camera, it uses facial recognition and document reading to match an end user’s face to their official identity documents, allowing for remote confirmation of a given user’s identity. The platform has seen remarkable growth in adoption over the past year, prompting Jumio to announce a new sales office for the APAC region earlier this month.

In a statement announcing the partnership, Monaco CEO and co-founder Kris Marszalek attested to the value of Jumio’s solution, saying, “Jumio’s AI-powered technologies fit with our priority of creating smooth and simple user journeys, keeping our users happy and increasing client retention by taking the complexities out of the online verification process usually associated with regulatory KYC and AML compliance.”

The move comes after Monaco contracted Gemalto to provide its physical Visa cards – designed to function together with its cryptocurrency app – last autumn."
"Cryptocurrency has been at the mercy of fluctuating public perception over the course of its lifecycle. Rejected by banks at its inception and then blown into a craze by the social media hype cycle, bitcoin has seen its true utility too often overshadowed by its instability. With a new focus on streamlining blockchain processes, some believe crypto could disrupt the tech giants with innovative opportunities in decentralization.

“I looked at it very much … as a new monetary system, and I still see unlimited opportunities in that area,” said Halsey Minor (pictured), founder and chief executive officer of VideoCoin Development Association Ltd. “It wasn’t until really a couple years later that I saw the blockchain as the new architecture for the computer.”

A tech pioneer with a knack for getting ahead of the trend with companies such as Salesforce.com Inc. and CNET, Minor intends to bridge efficiency gaps in blockchain and disrupt today’s online video industry with his new company VideoCoin. Minor spoke with John Furrier (@furrier) and Dave Vellante (@dvellante), co-hosts of theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s mobile livestreaming studio, at the Polycon18 event in the Bahamas. They discussed the dubious reputation of some of tech’s crazes and why blockchain and crypto are here to stay.

Minor firmly believes in the power of blockchain tech as a game-changing disruptor, both against tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and in favor of civilians with much to gain from decentralization. In 2013, his passion motivated the development of Uphold Inc., a company that boasted the tagline “The Internet of Money.”

“What motivated me to start Uphold [was] the ability to turn your phone into your bank and be able to exchange money … solving the ability for the poor to be able to move money around without having 10 to 20 to 30 percent of it taken away,” he said.

Despite remaining challenges in his journey to deliver financial equity to all, Minor has begun making strides toward decentralization in the two years since founding VideoCoin. Through the discovery that cryptomining success is dependent on access to power, Minor found he could leverage unused servers and data centers to perform his “video mining” and decentralize video encoding, storage and content distribution for a more cost-effective streaming process.

“All these companies are confronted with these costs, and they can’t monetize them,” Minor said. “We cut the cost 60 to 80 percent.”

In addition to lowering costs, VideoCoin also encourages a software developer community through what is essentially its open-source system. “Everything we build is open source … all the way through to the network,” he said. “It creates a palate for people to start innovating in video. Because really what’s happening is a lot of innovation is getting hurt by the fact these big guys totally dominate it.”

With VideoCoin initiatives at work transforming media, Minor plans to someday bring his subversive approach back to the financial sector. “The problem I set out to solve, which is really creating a more equitable financial system … is still not solved,” he said. Banks make about $37 billion a year in bounced-check fees, so simply by getting rid of those, he said, “you create a revolution.”

"Not a good as a whole for the cryptocurrency market again, but will it drop below $300 billion like it did last month? This still remains entirely unknown. Currently, Bitcoin holds a 41.9% dominance of the total market, which is the highest the coin has held since December. At press time, BTC is trading at $9,068.87 a coin, down only -3.46%, in 24 hours. Where the leader goes, the altcoins tend to follow. With over 1/3 dominance of the market, any big dip in BTC’s price could pull the market down quite easily.

Goldman Sachs’ (NYSE:GS) technical analysis team predicted another projected BTC price recently. The head of the team, Jafari, is notorious for criticizing cryptocurrency and more specifically BTC.  In July, he predicted BTC to reach $4,000 by the end of the year and we all know the cryptocurrency hit its record all-time high over $20,000, at that time. Non-the-less, the team predicts the next BTC correction to reach below its February lows under $5,900 – we shall see.

Not all coins are down on the market, let’s take a look at the few that are currently making gains and leading the down-trotted market.

After the largest cryptocurrency hack of all time, Coincheck has resumed normal business. It has begun paying back its victims the XEM they lost and the coin has been on an upward trend for the past week. Back in late Jan, the exchange announced it would repay its victims at a later time but last week, the timeline was disclosed to the public causing the coin to jump in price.

At press time, XEM is trading at $0.431 a coin, up 12.90%, in 24 hours.

Last week one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, was hacked. They later offered a $250K bounty paid out in BNB for anyone with information on the organized group of hackers. The hackers weren’t entirely successful, but my guess is that this was just a test to see how far into the system they could get before launching a full-scale attack. I’m not alone in my opinion; the exchange just announced the latest news regarding its future efforts against attacks:

“Binance has currently allocated the equivalent of $10,000,000 in crypto reserves for future bounty awards against any illegal hacking attempts on Binance. We have also invited other exchanges and crypto businesses to join our initiative. We welcome their participation at any time.”

Binance also published a statement today on the company’s plans to launch its own public blockchain named Binance Chain. This statement is most likely the reason for the coin’s recent price spike and it read:

“Binance Chain will focus on performance, ease-of-use, and liquidity. Binance Coin (BNB) will be upgraded to exist on its own blockchain mainnet, becoming a native coin. At the same time, Binance will transition from being a company to a community.”

At press time, BNB is trading at $9.87 a coin, up 23.55%, in 24 hours.

VeChain rebranded to VeChain Thor in late February but the coin flip has yet to occur. The main net to the new rebranded VeChain ecosystem is set to launch in June of this year. By the end of the year, the project’s dev team is hoping to expand with 100 new full stack developers to help build the whole ecosystem. This task could take years, so the new VET will be a long-term hold.

At press time, VEN is trading at $4.18 a coin, up 5.07%, in 24 hours."
"Colin Read, the Mayor of Plattsburgh, NY, will propose an 18-month moratorium on cryptocurrency mining while the city creates new zoning laws and regulations regarding non-residential energy consumption.

The town’s two Bitcoin operations are soaking up excess cheap power from local hydroelectric plants, risking higher power bills for ordinary homeowners.

Plattsburgh is a small town upstate, about 60 miles south of Montreal. It has a population of 20,000.

According to the city, the electricity consumed by the two Bitcoin facilities now exceed 10% of the city’s total reserves.

The two Bitcoin mining facilities — one of them an old paper mill converted into a Bitcoin mining plant by an entrepreneur named David Bowman — consume more than 11.2 megawatts of electricity.

One megawatt of coal-derived electrical energy can power between 600 and 1,200 homes.

“I think the proposed law is unnecessary and I’m worried that Plattsburgh could miss out on an opportunity for innovation.

“It’s basically in the early stages of development like the Internet was. In my view, an outright moratorium would hurt the city more in the long run because it would miss out on all that,” Bowman said.

Plattsburgh has a cheap, fixed supply of energy from hydroelectric dams it built in the 1950s.

Yet the two existing Bitcoin mining facilities regularly exceed the margin of extra supply, according to town managers.

The town would have to buy extra, and expensive, energy on the open market to close the gap. Those costs would be passed on to residents in the form of higher energy bills.

“Bitcoin mining operations are adding on top of that, so we have to buy more power — definitely this year we’ve had to buy a lot more power,” said Plattsburgh Municipal Lighting Department Manager Bill Treacey.

“My system only has a certain amount of capacity in it, and if they use that capacity then I’m going to have millions of dollars upgrading.”

Cryptocurrency mining involves the use of hundreds or thousands of energy-hungry computers designed to solve blockchain algorithms, which are complex mathematical problems.

As the problems are solved, the miner receives Bitcoins as a reward.

Mayor Read’s cryptocurrency mining ban proposal will be publicly debated by Plattsburgh city officials and residents at a town meeting on March 15.

If the 18-month cryptocurrency mining moratorium is enacted, Plattsburgh would become the first city in the United States to enforce such a cryptocurrency-related ban."
"Innovation is not difficult to come by in the world of blockchain technology. Loom Network aims to become a different breed of blockchain platform, as it mainly focuses on large-scale online games and applications. It is a very interesting approach, and now is a good time to take a closer look at what this particular project is all about.

There is a lot more to blockchain technology than just financial transactions. Even though it’s evident that this technology will mainly disrupt the financial sector, projects such as Loom Network show that there are other opportunities available. Right now, this project focuses on games and social applications which can make use of this technology.

Loom Network largely revolves around DAppChains. More specifically, it aims to establish an ecosystem where token-based karma, Ethereum-based crypto-collectibles, games, and social apps can all come together without any friction. All of this will be based on forkable, decentralized, and human-readable blockchain rulesets.

Moreover, Loom Network will help build games which cannot be built without the blockchain. Although it sounds like a niche market, the project’s team has rather bold ambitions. With provably scarce items, traceable tokens, and multi-game-spanning universes, there certainly are a lot of opportunities waiting to be explored. Additionally, the project also wants to build new types of social applications not inherently driven by advertising.

The DAppChains themselves are full-scale blockchains running in parallel to Ethereum smart contracts. In the modern world, they are referred to as sidechains, but they are a rather advanced form in terms of scaling data rather than focusing on regular network transactions. Through the Loom SDK, anyone can generate their own DAppChain with its own consensus mechanism. It is quite an interesting concept which will certainly attract a lot of attention moving forward.

As one would expect, Loom Network has its own token. It’s known as Loom, and it allows smart contract developers to make their DApps as secure and powerful as they want. This token is also a brand-new way to incentivize Ethereum-based DApps, which will be of great interest to developers all over the world.

Even though Loom Network will only launch this month, it will be interesting to see what the future holds for this platform. Building Twitter-scale apps on top of Ethereum will not be an easy feat. It is certainly possible to do so in the future, as Loom Network seems to offer a lot of additional scaling solutions for Ethereum in its current form."

"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) stock is holding steady Tuesday after researchers uncovered 13 vulnerabilities in the company’s Ryzen and EPYC chips that are similar to the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities uncovered in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) chips earlier this year.

According to security company CTS Labs, the vulnerabilities could allow potential hackers access to data stored on AMD processors and provide an opening for hackers to install malicious malware on the processors.

AMD’s Ryzen chips power desktop and laptop computers, and its EPYC chips power servers. Statista reports AMD processors are found in 22 percent of computers, while Intel processors hold a 77 percent market share.

“At AMD, security is a top priority and we are continually working to ensure the safety of our users as new risks arise. We are investigating this report, which we just received, to understand the methodology and merit of the findings,” an AMD spokesperson said in response to the new report.

Viceroy Research said Tuesday there may be no coming back from the new batch of vulnerabilities, some of which the firm says will be difficult or impossible for AMD to fix. In its report, Viceroy said the vulnerabilities likely came as a result of AMD rushing products to market to avoid falling further behind its peers. After consulting experts, Viceroy said the AMD vulnerabilities could be very dangerous on an international level and could do irreparable damage to AMD on a commercial level.

“In light of CTS’s discoveries, the meteoric rise of AMD’s stock price now appears to be totally unjustified and entirely unsustainable. We believe AMD is worth $0.00 and will have no choice but to file for Chapter 11 (Bankruptcy) in order to effectively deal with the repercussions of recent discoveries,” Viceroy said.

CNBC had originally planned to discuss Viceroy's report on “Halftime Report” show but later canceled the segment, leading some to question its validity.

According to Digitimes, demand for AMD processors from the cryptocurrency market could be dropping off. Market sources tell Digitimes that AMD competitor NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is already taking steps to respond to falling cryptocurrency demand.

In February, Bernstein analyst Mark Li said things could get ugly fast for AMD if cryptocurrency mining demand starts to fall.

“If mining eventually becomes sustainably unprofitable (for example, if currency pricing were to permanently collapse), there is a risk of cards purchased for mining getting dumped in the secondary market and depressing sales for a while,” he said in a note.

Li said mining demand is contingent on the price of cryptocurrency Ethereum. The price of Ethereum is down about 17 percent in the past week.

After initially dipping from its highs on Tuesday morning, AMD stock bounced back after investors seemingly shrugged off the new vulnerability report. AMD has witnessed some extraordinary option trading volume in recent days.

Benzinga Pro issued no less than 17 options trading alerts to subscribers on Monday between 9:33 a.m. and 12:15 p.m. Surprisingly, the majority of the option trading volume was bullish in nature.

At time of publication, AMD shares were flirting with the $12 level, up nearly 4 percent on the day after hitting an intra-day low of $11.10.

"Ripple [XRP] CEO Want You To Understand about Crypto Market

Cryptocurrencies are being created wherever you look today. People are drawn to them like bees to honey because of their promise of allowing people to make private and anonymous transactions. While some cryptocurrencies thrive and grow, others do not. But regardless of that, the crypto market is seeing a boom and is expected to continue doing so. In an interview with CNBC, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse touched upon a few key points on the crypto market.

Most of the crypto tokens available today only have a business model to show for their work and a speculative value. People invest in them to become overnight millionaires, thinking their cryptocurrency will become the next Bitcoin. However, Brad Garlinghouse said that any digital asset is only worth as much as the problem it solves. The blockchain revolution is a force for the greater good, not individual gain. This is why cryptocurrency creators should look for ways to use their coin to solve the issues that people face today.

Ripple [XRP] is known to be one of the cryptocurrencies which is on good terms with regulators and financial institutions. This is because of the nature of its operation, but also because Ripple never intended to work outside of the laws or circumvent them. Garlinghouse said the blockchain revolution has to take place from within the system so there’s no way that it can happen without assistance from and compliance with regulations and financial institutions. While most cryptocurrencies advocated down with the financial institutions and down with the government, they have to work together with these bodies for long-term sustenance and harmony.

Every digital asset should be different from the other. It’s not just their market worth but what they allow the user to do. It is not the creation of digital asset but its goal and purpose that should drive crypto projects. Investors and users should understand this as well, for it would enable them to make a better decision about which coin to invest in and use.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse answered a few questions about Ripple and the XRP token as well. Although many have accused Ripple as being centralized, he clarified that Ripple is the central organization that runs the operation while the XRP ledger is a decentralized entity just like any other. Since Ripple has $60 billion worth of Ripple, they want to see it succeed and try to provide as much value to users as possible. He gave Ripple’s example when talking about the value of digital tokens relating to the problem they solve. Ripple is a platform which allows cross-boundary transfers to take place within four seconds and with a much smaller fee.

This solves the problem for people losing money in transaction fee when different fiat currencies are converted into a globally accepted fiat currency before being converted into their own currency by their bank.

While Ripple [XRP] has already partnered with Moneygram and Western Union, more of such partnerships could be in the making. Garlinghouse said that when regulators realize that Ripple is in full compliance with their rules they are pleasantly surprised, which is why Wall Street personnel are comfortable with it as well.

When both the endpoints are established financial institutions, then people are more comfortable using the technology. Although Ripple was never intended to be a cryptocurrency token as such, it is currently available in 60 exchanges across the world, with speculation that Coinbase is set to add Ripple to its inventory soon. Garlinghouse merely said about it that the decision is for Coinbase to make.

This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrencies or a recommendation to invest. Historic performance is no guarantee of future returns. As an investment class, cryptocurrencies are speculative investments and investing in cryptocurrencies involves significant risks – they are highly volatile, vulnerable to hacking and capital loss and sensitive to secondary activity. Before investing you should obtain advice and decide whether the potential return outweighs the risks."

"BTCManager’s Weekly Cryptocurrency Outlook highlights the price action and technical indicators on a long-term basis to identify the best opportunities in the largest cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ether, and others.

The weekly chart below shows that the Awesome Oscillator has turned green for the week beginning March 12, which opens up the possibility for a bullish saucer signal for the week beginning March 19. For nine consecutive weeks, the Oscillator has remained red in color and switched (temporarily) to green last week before the market took a huge dive. We look to observe the Oscillator on March 19 to see if the color remains green and we look for another green bar to confirm the signal.

For this week, the conversion line has moved further below the base line, telling us that downward momentum is starting to gain strength. The supports indicated by the Ichimoku and fractals show that BTC-USD may extend as low as $8067.00 or even testing the most recent fractal support at $5920.72.

The conversion line provides resistance this week at $10,157.54 and a weekly close higher than this level is required to provide a bullish outlook for the weeks ahead. Otherwise, we look for the market to test support and head lower.

The daily chart below shows that BTC-USD is within equilibrium on this timeframe, sitting inside the Ichimoku cloud. A daily close below $9040.10 will generate a sell signal, that is, a close below the Ichimoku cloud for the first time January 16, when bitcoin fell by more than $2000 in a single day. If March 13’s price action is contained by the cloud, then we should look for a break of $9892.00. The $9892 level looks to be forming a fractal resistance, and the fractal is invalided if the market breaches the March 12 high before March 15.

So in short, if the market fails to break above $9892 by March 15, then downward momentum is likely to dominate, as BTC-USD looks for a new floor. Supports are highlighted in the chart below at $8522.99, $8366.00, $8067.00, $7588.01 and $6874.27. We also see that the Awesome Oscillator is negative and red in color.

On the other hand, if the market can breach $9892 in the next day or so, we should see the market test resistance provided by the cloud around $11,577. Another bullish indication is given the cloud itself, which has changed color from red to green in the past few days, which usually indicates an upward trend is to be anticipated. Therefore, we look to buy on a breakout of the cloud, i.e., a daily close above $11,577, if there is a daily close above $9040.10 on March 13 or alternatively, a break above the $9892 level.

Looking at the Renko chart (daily), we see that a downward trend is under way, with march 8 providing a sell signal once the first red Renko candle formed. The chart seems to indicate a move to $7,500 as the path of least resistance. A daily close above $11,249.76 is required for a trend reversal on the Renko chart, and provide justification to go long. If you are looking to short, the Renko chart tells us that your entry should be around $9374.80, so look for a bounce to near this level before going short (and target $7,500).

Nevertheless, the Awesome Oscillator suggests bearish momentum is weakening, as the indicator turns green and the bars are rising.

Finally, we look at the 4-hour timeframe. The Renko chart shows that BTC-USD is in a downtrend at the time of writing, with the most recent Renko candle a red one. A reversal to an upward trend is suggested once we observe a 4-hour session close above $9774.00. Moreover, the market is within the Ichimoku cloud and the cloud has changed color to green recently. Therefore, we wait for the market to form a new green Renko candle to go long.

The 4-hour standard candlestick chart below shows that the market is making higher lows as well as higher highs over the past four days or so. We see a bullish signal given by the lagging line (purple), which is moving above the previous price action. Immediate resistance lies at $9317.03 as indicated by the conversion line, and a 4-hour close above this level will increase the likelihood of a test of the Ichimoku’s upper span ($10,027). Therefore, we could enter a long position on a 4-hour close (if it is above $9317.03) and target the $10,000 handle.

The weekly chart for ether is displayed below and shows that the market is sitting just above an important support at $666.56. A weekly close below this level would open up supports at  $556.00 and $430.77. Ether’s chart looks to be lagging bitcoin’s, with the conversion line yet to cross below the base line. Moreover, the Awesome Oscillator remains red in color, suggesting no sign of a potential reversal yet.

Looking at the daily chart, we see three key levels to keep an eye on. Firstly, supports levels lie at $680.70 and $641.10; a daily close beneath either of these levels will point to further downside for ETH-USD. Resistance is seen at $719.11 and daily close above this level should provide further impetus for additional gains.

The Renko chart (daily) shows a breakout to the downside, so ETH-USD is likely to continue to display red Renko candles. As long as the market stays below $704.60, we see ether heading lower. A daily close below $634.14 would strengthen the bearish outlook, with a fresh red Renko forming below the previous low. Support is indicated at $386.13, the July 2017 high.

Moving onto the 4-hour price action, we see that ether has been making lower highs and higher lows, suggesting some indecisiveness in the market. The key fractal levels are highlighted, at $715.78 and $677.00 respectively. A break above $715.78 should see an attempt at the $750 handle, while a break below $677.00 will expose the $600 psychological level.

For the Renko 4-hour chart, ether is in an uptrend but a reversal looks to be imminent. A 4-hour session close below $681.20 will see the formation of a red Renko candle, which will give a signal to go short. Support is seen at $576.40. On the other hand, if the market can sustain above $681.20, there is a chance that the green Renko sequence will continue, with resistance indicated near $900.

The weekly chart below shows that ripple has continued to exhibit losses against bitcoin and is nearing an important support. Two weeks ago, a bearish hammer formed, with the low at 0.00007738. This level could form a fractal support, providing the current week’s price action manages to stay above this level.

However, momentum has turned bearish as indicated by the crossover of the base line above the conversion line, so another important support we could watch is the open of the large bullish candle from late December 2017 at 0.00007180. Therefore, we could see a brief, temporary reversal once the 0.00007180 level is tested.

If these support levels fail to hold, then it is a long way down for the altcoin, with fractal support found at 0.00003450.

The daily Renko chart shows XRP-BTC has moved out of equilibrium and below the Ichimoku cloud, giving a bearish outlook. The most recent fractal support in the way now is way down at 0.00001274. A daily close above 0.00009555 is required for the Renko charts to paint a green candle and, hence, a reversal of the current downtrend.

The daily candlestick chart shows a potential bearish saucer signal setting up for March 14. The signal will be triggered March 14 the earliest and we look to enter a short once the market breaches the March 13 low at 0.00008348. Once the bearish saucer signal is triggered, we look to target the supports at 0.00007738 and 0.00006151. Also, notice that the market is now below the open of the relatively large bullish candlestick from December 29, 2017, suggesting that bulls have lost control. Therefore, if we remain below 0.00008727, expect the market to continue to head lower. If the market manages to regain 0.00008727, then we are likely to see a reversal.

The weekly chart for bitcoin cash shows that this week may provide a bullish signal. For example, consider the lagging line (purple) which could possibly move above the previous price action, and therefore, give a bullish signal. We require a weekly close above 0.13688 for the signal to be triggered. The conversion line provides resistance at 0.1466 for the week beginning March 12 and has moved lower compared to last week, suggesting downside for BCH is more likely.

On the other hand, support lies at 0.1118 and a weekly close below this level will expose the 0.1000 psychological handle.

The daily chart shows a more bullish outlook, with the price action for BCH-BTC closing above the conversion line on March 9. The conversion line, at 0.1148, now provides support. The base line provides resistance at 0.1303 and a daily close above this level will open up an attempt at the Ichimoku cloud.

The Awesome Oscillator is green, but remains negative, suggesting that bearish momentum is weakening. We look for the oscillator to cross above zero to be more certain of an upward move.

However, the daily Renko chart shows a downtrend is under way for BCH-BTC, with a test of 0.09682965 looking likely. A daily close above 0.12727602 will invalidate the bearish outlook and lead to the formation of the first green Renko candle since late February.

The 4-hour chart also shows BCH-BTC in a downtrend. Unless we observe a 4-hour session close above 0.12100002, then the bearish outlook remains intact.

The weekly price action for LTC-USD shows a bearish signal was given on the close of last week’s candle. The price action closed below the base line, signaling bearish momentum is beginning to take hold. The market currently sits just above Fibonacci support at $171.934 with another support found at $144.580. A weekly close below $144.58 will point to a large downward move for litecoin, as this support held during the massive sell-off experienced in late January/early February.

Therefore, we look to buy LTC-USD if the Fib. support at $171.934 is intact by the end of the week. Alternatively, we require the market to close above the conversion line by the end of the week, that is a close higher than $179.69.

Looking at the weekly chart of LTC-BTC, we see that the pair has retreated from its recent high near 0.0250 and has found support at the 38.2 Fibonacci level near 0.0178. Since then, we have seen the market test the 50 and 61.8 percent Fibonacci levels and we should see a continuation of the upward trend. Therefore, we could look to buy near 0.0192 (50 percent Fib. level), or successively on each break of each Fib. level.

The daily chart shows a much more bearish outlook, with LTC-BTC looking to break below the Ichimoku cloud. Important support zones are found at 0.01830-0.01810 and then 0.01490. However, if March 13’s close manages to stay above the conversion line (i.e., 0.0194), then we may see bulls manage to pull litecoin higher. A daily close below 0.0194 will be considered bearish and anticipate a test of 0.0180. Moreover, we see that the lagging line (purple) is moving below the previous price action, giving another bearish signal.

The Awesome Oscillator looks to turn positive after remaining in the negative zone since March 5. Once the oscillator turns positive, we could buy LTC-BTC in anticipation of a test of the 0.02000 handle and above. Since the price action is contained within the cloud, it may be safer to wait for a daily close either above or below the cloud before deciding on a position. A daily close below 0.0192 will indicate a bearish cloud breakout, whereas a daily close above 0.0192 may save litecoin bulls from feeling more pain.

Cardano has gone on to post more losses against bitcoin and has failed to find support at 0.00002766. Looking at the weekly chart, we see that since posting the all-time high at 0.00009180, the market has gone on to establish six near consecutive lower lows, suggesting in one to five weeks time, we should see ADA-BTC bottom out, as bears become exhausted. Remember, the near consecutive (or record high/low) rule states that after seven to ten near consecutive higher highs/lower lows, the probability of a reversal increases substantially.

If the market can manage to stay above 0.00002290 for the rest of the week, we may have the bottom in, as the lagging line looks to be forming a trough. However, we cautiously await the weekly close to confirm the validity of the trough.

The daily chart shows some more indications that the market has bottomed out. For instance, the conversion line has started to flatten out and we look for a daily close above this indicator to give further confirmation. A daily close above the conversion line should motivate a move toward the most recent fractal resistance, at 0.00003520.

On the other hand, a move below 0.00002177 will open up further losses and motivate a short position, with a move toward 0.00001000 the most likely destination.

Looking at the daily Renko chart, we see ADA-BTC is still in a downward trend and that a daily close above 0.00002760 is required to give a reversal signal. Regarding the next support level, the daily Renko suggests 0.00000690 is the only remaining support.

Ether Classic has hardly changed from the week’s open, but the outlook is bearish given that the market closed below the base line on March 5. Therefore, we could look to buy near the support highlighted below, i.e., at 0.00170 and 0.00130383. A weekly close above the base line (0.0027) will also motivate long positions. The Awesome Oscillator has turned positive, suggesting momentum is beginning to turn in favor of bulls.

The daily chart also shows a bearish outlook, with a move below the fractal at 0.00213501 looking imminent. A daily close below this level would open up 0.00179999. Notice that the lagging line has also broken below its previous trough, opening up further downside. The next support indicated by the lagging line is at the 0.0018 level.

The daily Renko shows a more bearish outlook, with a move toward 0.00148812 to be expected.

The big story of the past few days was the alleged Binance ‘hack,’ but the exchange responded swiftly and reassured crypto investors, which could be contributing to the bullish show of force for Binance’s own cryptocurrency (BNB).

The weekly chart below shows that since finding support near the 38.2 percent retracement level, the market has surpassed the 50 percent Fibonacci level, providing a bullish bias. Furthermore, the market has moved back above the base line (red) and if the weekly close is higher than this level, BNB will be a strong buy. The base line lies at 0.0010, and we need a weekly close higher than this to motivate a long-term buy position. The market has also tested the conversion line, providing resistance at 0.0012. Finally, we see a trough being formed by the lagging line, suggesting BNB-BTC bottomed out around 0.00086 last week.

The daily chart shows the market is attempting a cloud breakout, supported by a surge in volume. Resistances are seen at 0.0013239 and 0.0016160. We also see that the Ichimoku cloud looks to change color from red to green, giving another bullish signal. We get stronger confirmation if we observe a daily close above the cloud.

The daily Renko chart also shows that a reversal is under way for BNB-BTC, with a green Renko candlestick looking to form for the first time since late January. Therefore, we look to go long on BNB-BTC if the daily close is above 0.0010699, at which point the first green Renko candle will form after successive red Renkos.

The weekly chart shows the market is sitting just above support at $241.71, so we look to buy near this level. Further support is provided by the trough of the lagging line at $216.50. XMR-USD looks to close below the base line this week, giving a weak bearish signal. Nevertheless, the Awesome Oscillator remains green and continues to trend higher, although we are unlikely to get a bullish saucer signal, unless the market moves above $379.00 by March 19.

Buys at $241.71 and $216.50 should target the Fibonacci extension level at $374.09.

The daily Renko chart shows the current downtrend could extend as low as $190.65 and a daily close above $343 is required for a reversal.

The 4-hour Renko chart shows that XMR-USD is in equilibrium. A 4-hour close above $280.40 is required for a bullish reversal, whereas a bearish breakout is indicated with a 4-hour session close below $238.34. If the trend reversal is realized, we look to target the $360 zone. On the other hand, in the event of a bearish breakout, expect monero to sink to the $220 zone.

"Byteball Bytes (CURRENCY:GBYTE) traded 9.1% lower against the US dollar during the 1 day period ending at 14:00 PM E.T. on March 13th. During the last week, Byteball Bytes has traded down 41% against the US dollar. Byteball Bytes has a total market cap of $160.81 million and $1.25 million worth of Byteball Bytes was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. One Byteball Bytes coin can currently be purchased for approximately $249.23 or 0.02710300 BTC on popular cryptocurrency exchanges including Cryptopia, Bittrex and Cryptox.

Here is how other cryptocurrencies have performed during the last 24 hours:

Byteball Bytes’ genesis date was December 25th, 2016. Byteball Bytes’ total supply is 1,000,000 coins and its circulating supply is 645,222 coins. Byteball Bytes’ official website is byteball.org.

Byteball Bytes’ official Twitter account is @

and its Facebook page is accessible here.

According to CryptoCompare, “Byteball is a decentralized database with it's own native cryptocurrency, Bytes, that unlike most does not require PoW or PoS mining and does not have a blockchain nor blocks. Instead, Byteball links transactions by signing the hashes from the previous transactions on the new one. These links between transactions form a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Since Byteball has no blocks, there is no block size issue. Byteball can be used as a means to transfer value between users in a transaction, either with Bytes or assets that can be issued on the network or as a decentralized data base that allows users to store information within it. Byteball's currency, Bytes, are used to pay transaction fees in this network. Transactions can be meant to exchange value or to store any type of data. The transaction fees (Bytes) are relative to the Bytes used in the transaction, so if a transaction uses 500 Bytes, that's the tx fee that will be charged. This system gives the currency intrinsic value, each Byte is worth a byte of information that is stored on the network, which alows the system to scale according to its use. 1 GBYTE equals 1000000000 BYTES “

"Thuntee Sukchotrat, chief executive officer of the JIBEX Co, said the company will launch a market platform for investors in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ethereum, and ripple. He said the firm would comply by the rules issued by the government.

The Revenue Department’s plan to collect a 15 per cent tax on capital gain or dividend generated from digital assets could have some impact on the company, but it is an investment of high risk and high returns, he said.

“More and more people are talking about investment opportunities in digital currencies and the potential high growth of the market”, said Thuntee who is a specialist in big data and information technology.

Currently there are two exchanges offering trading to investors in Thailand, namely BX and TDAX, with an estimated daily trading volume of Bt 90 million and 10 million respectively, he said

Market value of cryptocurrencies is estimated at around Bt4 to Bt5 billion while the global market is worth Bt12 trillion.

New investors should wait for the announcement of the digital asset rule from the government before jumping into the market, said Thuntee.

The company targets revenue of Bt 170 million in the first year of operations.

It’s revenue would be fee-based, or 0.25 per cent on top of each transaction. It is the market price, he said, in referring to fee charged on investors.

The company will offer cryptocurrency wallet to investors who register for trading on the exchange. The JIBEX wallet, incorporating a security system known as know-your-customer (KYC), will be on par with banking standard . The KYC will end regulator’s concerns on cryptocurrency fraud or money laundering activities. “We are ready to comply with the rules enforced by regulators,” said Thuntee. Blockchain technology will also track the trail of digital transactions to reduce the risk of fraud or illegal activities, he assured.

In the first phase of operation , trading will cover five digital currencies namely bitcoin, ehterreum, bitcoin cash, ripple and litecoin. The second phase will allow investors to trade baht and cryptocurrencies . The third phase will offer investors investment tools such as robot trade and will incorporate e-commerce feature in order to allow investors using digital currencies in exchange for goods and services.

The final phase will launch wealth management service for investors, according to Thuntee.

He claims that the company is in partnerships with IT security firms, brokerage firms and commercial banks , necessary for operating the exchange which will also be connected to foreign exchanges trading digital currencies, he said.

The company has a registered capital of Bt5 million. 51 per cent of company shares is held by Somyot Chaowalit, managing director of J I B Computer Group (JIB), a major computer vendors; 29 per cent by Thuntee with the rest held by its IT partners.

“The company will increase capital if required by the regulator,” added Thuntee."

"The Iowa City Area Chamber of Commerce is now accepting Bitcoin payments for membership dues.



 Chamber President Kim Casko made the surprise announcement on Tuesday morning at Iowa City’s TechBrew meeting, a monthly event hosted by the Technology Association of Iowa. The chamber accepted its first Bitcoin payment on Friday, Casko said.



 “Cryptocurrency is becoming more and more popular, especially in our community. There’s a ton of startup businesses forming around this technology,” Casko said. “We thought, ‘let’s be ahead of trend.’”



 After working with University of Iowa student Cameron Schorg, the chamber set up a bitcoin wallet through BitPay. One the chamber receives payment through BitPay, the payment can be transferred to U.S. dollars with a small transaction fee, and deposited in the chamber’s regular bank accounts. 

 The chamber began working on accepting the international cryptocurrency after Schorg inquired about becoming a Chamber of Commerce member. As of Tuesday, no other area business has asked to pay membership dues through Bitcoin, Casko said, although some Iowa City businesses are dealing directly with cryptocurrency markets.



 “We’ll see - based on the news getting out today, I don’t know if more will look to join. If they are, we’re capable of receiving that payment now,” Casko said. “I think the next step is to look at, where else do we want to accept it and what would that look like.”



 Is it the first Chamber of Commerce to accept Bitcoin payments? Chamber staff members have tried to verify it - calling national Chamber of Commerce professional associations, and branches in New York City, Austin, Texas and Silicon Valley. So far, staff has only identified one Chamber of Digital Commerce based out of Washington, D.C., Casko said.



 They did beat one big name - while Overstock and Expedia accept transactions using Bitcoin, internet giant Amazon has yet to announce future plans surrounding cryptocurrency payments.



 “Everyone’s waiting to hear if they’re going to accept it or not, and we’re tracking that too. It’s kind of fun for us to say, ‘well, we beat Amazon,’” Casko said."

"The price of altcoin NEM (XEM) increased by nearly 19 percent today following the news that Japanese cryptocurrency Coincheck has completed a promised refund to customers and resumed some trading services.

In a report from the Japan Times, the Tokyo-based exchange distributed ¥46.6 billion ($440 million) to all 260,000 customers who lost their holdings of XEM, the native token for NEM during the Coincheck hack at the end of January.

In a blog post from yesterday, the exchange explained that it would refund users at the rate of 88.549 Japanese yen ($0.83) per NEM token that was stolen during the hack.

The company is said to have used their own funds to reimburse its customers.

According to company spokesman Yosuke Imai, ‘procedures have been completed with the accounts of all 260,000 customers.’

Trading also resumed at the exchange following a month-long suspension that saw users’ assets frozen as Coincheck undertook procedures to improve security protocols. In response to the news, the price of NEM rose to $0.45, earlier today, prompting investors to trade $140 million dollars worth of the altcoin in 24 hours.

On the 26th January, thieves were able to steal 523 million units of NEM, worth around $530 million, in what has become the largest hack of its kind. Responding to the situation, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) suspected that it was down to a lack of proper security measures that allowed the thieves to siphon off with customer assets.

After inspecting the exchange, the FSA subsequently issued Coincheck with two improvement orders.

The move to reimburse customer funds is in response to several lawsuits filed against the exchange in addition to the FSA’s concerns over how it was going to refund customers. Last month, Coincheck was hit by two class action lawsuits from frustrated investors over withdrawal freezes.

The first lawsuit involving a group of seven investors wanted the exchange to allow it to withdraw assets worth up to $183,000. The second, which consisted of 132 investors, were seeking a reimbursement of $2.1 million after their assets were frozen.

The hack at Coincheck has put the limelight on Japan’s crypto exchanges and the measures they have in place to ensure customer assets are safe. As a result, the FSA suspended two digital currency exchanges for a month – Kanagawa-based FSHO and Nagoya-based Bit Station – as it ordered Coincheck to ‘conduct a drastic review on its management team’ last week.

According to the FSA, Bit Station intends to drop its application to become a registered exchange."
"Binance is putting its business on the blockchain.

The largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume is developing a public blockchain for the transfer and trading of digital assets, the company said in a statement posted on its website. The network, called Binance Chain, will provide coin traders a decentralized exchange that handles transactions through an automated process, eliminating the need for a third party to hold and trade funds.

The move comes as platforms that trade cryptocurrencies have become increasingly juicy targets for cyber thieves. Most exchanges are centralized, with assets held in one location. But decentralized exchanges are less prone to hacking risk because the funds are held in the participants’ wallets.

Since the start of this year, hackers have stolen tokens worth about $700 million from venues in Japan and Italy. The robberies have added pressure on both exchanges and regulators to do more to protect investors.

Binance itself was the target last week of a “large-scale phishing and stealing attempt.” The company is offering the equivalent of $250,000 in cryptocurrency for information that leads to the arrest of the hackers.

The new exchange is currently in development and the company did not provide a timeline for when it will become active.

Binance’s cryptocurrency, called Binance Coin, will be based on its own blockchain. The coin jumped 23 percent after the announcement."
"The term ""cryptocurrency"" has made the rounds all over the globe. However, there's a new warning for investors hoping to get rich quick off the roller coaster value in recent months.

Retiree Alan Wiener decided to invest $30,000 after researching cryptocurrency. Wiener chose Coinbase to manage that transfer, a digital currency exchange.

He wired the money from his wife's bank account to his Coinbase account, but the money never showed up.

Wiener then called and emailed several times but got no response from Coinbase.

""I'm really not willing to accept the risk that someone is going to take my money and not be responsive and return it after many, many requests,"" Wiener said. ""A lot of times I get no response at all, and occasionally I'll get a response and we're working on your problem.""

Coinbase says the name on the bank wire must match the legal name on the Coinbase account.

You must also include your unique reference code.

"Ripple (XRP) – There seems to be a relationship between Google, Facebook and Ripple on cryptocurrency regulation owing to corresponding statements coming from their ends. That Facebook and Google are centralized attest to the fact that they monitors what people do on their platforms. A little while ago, around January, news of Facebook clamping down on ads that has to do with cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offering (ICO) among others were all in the air, until they were completely banned. Mark Zuckerberg firm said his company is not interested in favoring unethical cryptocurrency advertisers.

It is no big deal to say ads can lure unsuspecting Facebook users into investing in ICO that won’t materialize into something worthwhile, it is as well right to put a stop to it. But what is completely out of it is to exclude those who do not join in the campaign. The ban signals that Facebook users won’t be seeing Bitcoin and altcoins advertisements, Initial Coin Offering and any cryptocurrency ads on the social media platform.

In what many analyst refer to as “concentrated ban on cryptocurrency, ICO or Bitcoin adverts”, Zuckerberg’s firm says the clamp down is due to some cryptocurrency advert relating directly with “misleading or deceptive promotional practices.” The efforts in many stances are directly affecting financial service providers who have nothing deceptive in their dealings but because they have something to do with cryptocurrency. Facebook claims the action is in the interest of users and that it will deal decisively with Adverts failing to comply.

A while after Facebook’s action, some advertisers alleged Google of hiding their ads from people. While this may be true, Google has not officially revealed anything to deny the action or substantiate the reason behind its action. Some advertisers alleged that there is a drastic drop in their ad views, while some are saying their accounts and ads have been suspended. The alleged ban is not restricted to Google Adword advertisers alone, it also affected Vloggers on Youtube who were banned without prior warning.

In a separate statement in January, Facebook Co-founder Mark Zuckerberg on his social media page says he is now deeply researching on blockchain stating that he’s “interested in going deeper and studying the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.”

Zuckerberg, who passed his sentiment on cryptocurrency, says encryption and cryptocurrency which “take power from centralized systems and put it back into people’s hands comes with risk of being harder to control”, and that he would be delving into them this year.

While Zuckerberg made the whole wide world happy, his statement was perceived as a giant step for the cryptocurrency world at large.  Being an investor, Zuckerberg is always open to venturing into and tapping from new opportunities in the society. He observes and acts on latest trends, and convert them into wealth without any delay. This has made Facebook acquired 66 companies, spending $23,124,700, 000 on disclosed acquisition. Maybe Zuckerberg intends investing a whopping sum into cryptocurrency, observers have been conjecturing.

The latter statement made by Zuckerberg on supporting cryptocurrency and Facebook’s recent clamp down on the cryptoverse really point to the hypocrisy of Zuckerberg and tells a lot about the attitude of Facebook toward decentralization. He at one time pledged to look into Cryptocurrency, and at another point, his firm is clamping down on the new tech alien.

Google has not revealed its plans to join the cryptocurrency world, but there are numerous pointers that the giant search engine is eyeing cryptocurrency, either getting its own or using a viable one as a means of exchange. Remember in 2014, Director of Google Idea, Jad Cohen, in a statement revealed that the cryptoworld is a new space but it is unclear how digital currencies will evolve.

Jad sees future in cryptocurrency, but the only thing that hinders him is “lack of regulation” which made him say “there’s a danger to it not being regulated in some form.” Jad is an employee at Google, he understands that whatever is being said has to fall back on Google even if it does not completely reflect the company’s stand.

In another dimension, last year, in what could be called a major cryptocurrency boost, Google Ventures invested $25 million into Currencycloud, a cross-border payments provider based in the UK. That being the first time Google would be investing in a Fintech company is signaling the possibility of Google joining the cryptocurrency world.

Mark Zuckerberg says Cryptocurrency needs regulations, this is also the assumption of Jad Cohen, an important employee at Google. The two firms are clamoring for regulations of cryptocurrencies. While they were doing this, the government has also raised concern on this. Different countries are calling for cryptocurrency regulation, in support of the demand made by financial companies and world investors who see cryptocurrency as a future threat.

It is no doubt that regulating cryptocurrency may make the financial technology alien become centralized, however, in the few of some, regulations on cryptocurrency makes it secure and more bankable.

The United States financial monitor, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in different summons argued that digital currencies and token falls under “security” going by the US security laws.

The moment SEC raised security concern over cryptocoins and exchanger platforms, Ripple was the first to pledge allegiance to the demand of the government. In an interview with CNBC, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said “It’s incredibly important that the entire industry recognizes that we have to work with the regulators, we have to work with the system.”

Although, Brad’s assertion is not in tandem with what crypto-enthusiasts believe. Enthusiasts are of the opinion that Bitcoin and other altcoins should not be regulated, however, he, Brad seems to be speaking the mind of few people in the cryptoverse and those who are scared of the possible dangers in cryptocurrency.

Ripple is the only cryptocoin to first observe regulations from different angle, pledge support, and dance to the tune of security checkmate that SEC calls a necessity.

Facebook, Google, and even Ripple are on the same line. They see cryptocurrency from the same angle. There is high possibility that the three giants may have the intention of working together on regulations. If they are not, will Google and Facebook who shout regulation, support Ripple or invent new cryptocurrencies? Founding new cryptocurrencies may not be necessary, since Ripple (XRP) has pledged support for the regulation. A new cryptocoin, which Google and Facebook may be planning to invent would not be necessary again.

Nothing is impossible, but going by Ripple’s wide popularity today, especially its enriched cross-border transaction technology, which Currencycloud, a company Google invested in, is also into, there is possibility they collaborate to bring out something viable. A Facebook-Google-Ripple collaboration should not be doubted. Only future will tell if it is possible or not."

"Cryptocurrencies may be a controversial investment, but according to coinmarketcap.com roughly $367 billion was invested in them as of March 13 and more money is likely headed into a market that includes bitcoin and ripple.

According to a survey from the consulting firm deVere Group, six out of 10 people not invested in cryptocurrencies are thinking about entering the market while seven out of 10 people already invested are considering an increase in their exposure in the next 12 months.

When respondents not invested in cryptocurrencies were asked if they would consider or are considering including at least one cryptocurrency in their investment portfolios, 62% said yes, 26% answered no and 12% said they didn’t know. The respondents lived in the U.S., the U.K., Australia, the UAE, Qatar, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Spain, France, Germany and South Africa.

Meanwhile, 71% of investors who do currently have cryptocurrencies as part of their portfolio said that they are looking to increase their exposure over the next year, 25% said that they would not and 4% said they didn’t know.

Bitcoin has attracted controversy. Some think the value of the cryptocurrency will drop to zero even if they are supportive of blockchain, the underlying ledger technology.

Steve Strongin, head of global investment research at Goldman Sachs, said in a Q&A published in a Feb. 5 research note, that he believes that most cryptocurrencies will ultimately fall to zero because current iterations are “too primitive” to be viable in the long term.

If all cryptocurrencies dropped to zero today, investors would stand to lose the roughly $367 billion invested in cryptocurrencies. But if investors continue to flock to cryptocurrencies, as the deVere survey suggests, a lot more money could be at risk.

According to the 2017 Investment Company Fact Book, total worldwide assets invested in regulated open-end funds was $40.4 trillion in 2016.

While cryptocurrencies do have many naysayers, there are also those who are neutral and even supportive. Opinions are divided – even at Goldman.

The firm’s global head of commodities research, Jeff Currie, told Bloomberg TV, “I don’t see why there is all this hostility to it.” Bitcoin is “not much different than gold” because it doesn’t have liability attached to it, by definition, like a security.

Also in an interview with Bloomberg TV, the top boss at Goldman, CEO Lloyd Blankfein, when discussing bitcoin said,  “I don’t have an investment in it, but I'm not willing to pooh-pooh it, and that’s why I say I'm open to it.”"
"Workers who make money on digital apps and work on their own schedules, can live very different lives than their traditional employee counterparts.

Soon, they might not even be paid the same kind of money.

A number of companies are designing payment platforms and cryptocurrencies specifically for the sharing economy, which they say is in need of a more fair and efficient path to compensation.

What's more, they say, the sharing economy might end up serving as an experiment for adapting digital tokens as a chief form of payment.

These companies have a tough case to make: that workers should trust their livelihood to the nascent and unpredictable sphere of cryptocurrencies."

"Tokyo: Japan-based virtual currency exchange Coincheck said on Tuesday it had refunded more than 440 million to customers following the hack of its systems, which was one of the largest thefts of its kind. The company said it used its own funds to reimburse about 46.6 billion yen ( 440 million) to all 260,000 customers who lost their holdings of NEM, a leading cryptocurrency. ""Procedures have been completed with the accounts of all 260,000 customers,"" company spokesman Yosuke Imai told reporters. Thieves syphoned away 523 million units of the cryptocurrency from Coincheck — then valued at 547 million — during the January 26 hack, which exceeded the 480 million in bitcoin stolen in 2014 from another Japanese exchange, MtGox. The 2014 hack prompted Japan to issue new regulations, requiring exchanges to obtain a government licence, but Coincheck was allowed to continue operating while the Financial Services Agency was reviewing its application. Authorities raided Coincheck's office last month and have slapped the company with sanctions. Coincheck chief operating officer Yusuke Otsuka said last week that the company's system was breached after several staff members opened emails containing malware. The firm had failed to upgrade its systems to keep up with the rapid expansion of the cryptocurrency market, he said. In February, seven plaintiffs — two companies and five individuals — filed a lawsuit against Coincheck seeking the reimbursement of 19.53 million yen in lost virtual currency and further compensation for interest lost due to the hack."

If you were hoping that might ease the current gaming GPU crisis then I’m afraid you are going to be disappointed. All it will  mean is a large percentage of the graphics cards that get manufactured won’t be suitable for gaming, but they’ll all still be setup for mining. Curse those miners...

"As regulation of the cryptocurrency industry intensifies, a prominent bullish duo has proposed one way to disabuse critics of the notion that the nascent sector represents a Wild West of investing.

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who founded digital-currency exchange Gemini, are putting forward a framework for self-regulation of the virtual-currency sector called the Virtual Commodity Association (VCA).

In a blog post, the Winklevoss twins say a dearth of regulation and the need for change as the market attempts to evolve, has prompted them to push for the industry to adopt broad practices around responsible financial management, transparency, cybersecurity and record-keeping. The twins also say self-regulation doesn’t preclude the need to work along side regulators.

The proposal comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned that it is taking a hard look at exchanges, threatening to crack down on cryptocurrency platforms.

“If a platform offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an ‘exchange,’ as defined by the federal securities laws, then the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration,” the SEC said.

In the past, the Winklevoss twins have said that they believe bitcoin has the potential to disrupt the gold GCJ8, +0.11%  market, with the value of a single bitcoin potentially hitting $320,000.

Bitcoin emerged out of obscurity—the remit of illicit transactions and technophiles—and in to the mainstream spotlight in 2017. However, that heightened attention hasn’t helped propel the No. 1 digital currency, bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.79% to new heights in 2018, with the asset shedding about half its value since hitting an all-time peak near $20,000 in late December."
Why This Cryptocurrency Mining Calendar App Wasn't Such a Great Idea
"HDFC Bank has banned the buying of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies via its bank’s debit, credit and prepaid cards. Apart from Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies, the bank has disallowed customers from buying any virtual currency too via HDFC issued cards.

In a circular to the HDFC Bank customers, it said: “You may be aware of the increasing global apprehensions regarding Bitcoins, cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies. The Reserve Bank of India has also cautioned the public regarding the potential economic, operational, legal and security-related risks associated in dealing with such currencies.”

“To ensure our customer’s security, we have decided to not permit usage of HDFC Bank Credit, Debit and Prepaid Cards towards purchase or trading of such Bitcoins, cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies, on merchants suspected to be dealing in crypto-currency or online foreign exchange trading or both,” the circular added.

However, HDFC is not the first bank to take a step of this sorts against cryptocurrency. Earlier in mid-February, Citi Bank had banned its customers from buying cryptocurrencies using credit and debit cards.

It said in an email circular: “Given concerns, both globally and locally including from the Reserve Bank of India, cautioning members of the public regarding the potential economic, financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks associated in dealing with bitcoins, cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies, Citi India has decided to not permit usage of its credit and debit cards towards purchase or trading of such bitcoins, cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies.”

The government has been against bitcoin or such cryptocurrency trading and Arun Jaitley on January 1, 2018 emphasised the same. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said Bitcoins or such crypto-currencies are not legal tender and those indulging in such transactions are doing it at their own risk. During the Question Hour in Rajya Sabha.

DMK member Kanimozhi sought to know whether the government was considering regulating crypto-currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as India “accounts for more than 11 per cent” of such trade globally."
"It’s a seller’s market for domains suggestive of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchains. The domain name Tokens.com sold for $500,000 in February. Cryptoworld.com sold for $195,000 in January. Eth.com sold for $2 million at the end of 2017. Blockchain.us wants $3.45 million, and Ethereum.com is asking for $10 million. In this climate, a domain like Crypto.com is likely worth millions of dollars. But Matt Blaze, who has owned it since 1993, isn’t selling.

“No, my domain name isn’t for sale. Yes, I mean it. Yes, I’ve probably already muted you,” he tweeted in September.

Blaze is an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a well-regarded cryptography researcher who is credited with the phrase and concept of “trust management,” an important framework for modeling the authenticity and reliability of parties in information security. More recently, he has been heavily involved in cybersecurity research around voting machines, and he testified in front of Congress in November. He did not respond to a request for comment, but he apparently registered the domain fairly easily. “People my age could just register names like that when we were your age,” he told security researcher Melissa Elliott on Twitter.

“It’s actually an unbelievable domain,” said Niko Younts, who sold BitcoinWallet.com for $250,000 back in 2014 and currently holds a portfolio of more than 1,000 cryptocurrency-related domains. “That word ‘crypto’ is very powerful to industry leaders, and from a marketing perspective. It could be quite literally a $10 million domain.”

Other domain sellers agreed. The pseudonymous administrator of Crypto Domains, who claims to have sold coingeek.com to billionaire and cryptocurrency enthusiast Calvin Ayre, says they would price it “in the $5 to $10 million dollar range.” New.life, another domain seller who also asked to remain pseudonymous, also priced crypto.com at $5 million to $10 million. “Crypto.com is attractive because it defines a space where billions of dollars are changing hand with the amount growing annually,” Ron Jackson, the editor of Domain Name Journal, said in an email. “I think it is definitely a 7-figure domain name. Rare to see $5-$10 million these days but I wouldn’t be shocked if it did hit $5 million.”

That’s a lot of money for anyone, and the offers have been pouring in. Blaze tweeted in January that a hopeful buyer had called his university trying to get ahold of him. “Note to the idiot who hassled my department receptionist about wanting to buy my domain. It’s not for sale,” he wrote. “And if it were for sale, it definitely wouldn’t be for sale to you.” Although the frothy market for domains peaked in December when the price of Bitcoin hit $20,000, Blaze has been getting inquiries for a while. “Just got angry email from someone who wants to buy my domain (not for sale, btw) insisting I must sell it because capitalism,” he tweeted last June. “If you want my domain bc you’re speculating on crypto currency, just send me all your bitcoins instead. I promise to lose them for you.”

The “crypto” in Blaze’s domain name is a reference to cryptography, a long-standing shorthand in the information security community. (See “don’t roll your own crypto,” a common aphorism that refers to the riskiness of developing new encryption methods instead of using established ones, as just one example.) People outside the cryptography community started using “crypto” to refer to Bitcoin and its descendants, however, as a flood of cryptocurrencies debuted over the last year.

This new colloquial use of “crypto” caused consternation in security circles. “On the internet, ‘crypto’ has always been used to refer to cryptography,” wrote Motherboard cybersecurity reporter Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai. “Think, for example, the term ‘Crypto Wars,’ which refer to government (originally the US government) efforts to undermine and slow down the adoption of unbreakable communications systems.”

Blaze himself scored a decisive blow in the Crypto Wars in 1994 when he discovered that the Clipper Chip, a device designed to allow the government to listen in on anyone’s phone calls, had a critical flaw that would allow criminals to circumvent its purpose. His paper about it, “Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption Standard,” is available on crypto.com.

“I think calling cryptocurrencies ‘crypto’ is a poor choice, with bad consequences for both cryptography and cryptocurrencies,” he wrote on Twitter. “That doesn’t mean I’m some kind of language prescriptivist, and your saying that ‘language evolves’ or other such prattle doesn’t invalidate my concerns.”

In response to this attitude and his refusal to sell his domain, Blaze has been told that he is shortsighted, doesn’t deserve the domain, or is just bitter that he didn’t get on the lucrative cryptocurrency train earlier. One Twitter user told Blaze he is “greatly under-utilizing an incredible asset and defacing it with political nonsense that would make CNN proud” before adding “don’t be afraid to ask for $30+ million.” Another Twitter user advised Blaze to hold out for a billion.

Earlier this month, Blaze added a disclaimer to his website. It says: “This site does not trade in or provide services related to cryptocurrencies. It is concerned with cryptography, computer and network security, and technology policy research. Warning: Many cryptocurrencies are scams, and I strongly advise against their use as investment vehicles.”

This isn’t the first time Blaze has had to defend his domain. In 2000, amid the dot-com frenzy, a Delaware company calling itself Crypto.Com, Inc. started pitching “a new keyless encryption technology for secure communications on insecure circuits.” Blaze posted a statement on crypto.com calling the claims “extravagant” and noting that he has no affiliation with the company. He also pointed to cryptographer Claude Shannon’s proof of perfect secrecy, which showed unbreakable encryption over “insecure circuits” requires the use of a key. As they say, don’t roll your own crypto."
"BANGKOK — Thailand’s cabinet agreed Tuesday to draft a law to oversee cryptocurrency trading, seeking to tax the largely unregulated market.

Government spokesman Nathporn Chatusripitak said the Ministry of Finance also proposed the new regulations to help prevent use of digital currencies in money laundering and fraud.

He said details of the proposed regulations would be announced later this the month.

In February, Thailand’s central bank issued a circular asking financial institutions to not handle transactions involving cryptocurrencies.

Across Asia, governments have been belatedly moving to exert control over bitcoin exchanges and other fast-growing cryptocurrency-related activities."

 1 - Intrinsic Value: Though the term in this context is still evolving, for now, intrinsic value refers to the sum of services that a cryptocurrency and its underlying technology provides. If a crypto is in use ( you can check Blocktivity) and actually solves a real-world problem, then you need to investigate the company's development capacity to outpace othercompeting crypto technologies to speculate on the viability of its continuing use. Cryptos backed by large corporate partners may be a plus, but you have to figure out whether the corporate partner actually injected capital into it, has a contractual agreement with the crypto developer, and is actively involved in the cryptos development--in short, you need to get a sense of the quality, motivation, and goal of the corporate partnership. Newer cryptos have already been exposed to the scalability problems experienced by older cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum; so find out what solution a given cryptocurrency is implementing to solve the scalability problem. A protocol coin is there to support an entire blockchain ecosystem; for a protocol coin to be rendered obsolete, the entire ecosystem must collapse. A utility coin is built atop an app within a blockchain ecosystem; for a utility coin to be rendered obsolete, all it takes is for nobody to use that app. Both have a different set of risks and opportunities for wider usage--choose carefully. Last but not least, you need to figure out of a cryptocurrency is solely used for trading or people might actually need to use it for reasons other than financial speculation. Also, try to determine if a crypto, most likely a utility token, is targeting a particular industry, and do your best to assess the viability of its usage within that industry; ultimately, it all boils down to market demand and the nature of that demand, whether speculation or industry use. THE TAKEAWAY: These three fundamental factors--intrinsic value, coin type, and the motivations driving demand--provide a basic framework to help you begin assessing a potential cryptocurrency investment (emphasis on ""begin""). Although there are several other factors to consider, the ones mentioned above can serve as guideposts to help you direct your research.

"Whether it’s for a sweepstakes prize, loyalty reward or purchase premium, marketers always want to associate their brand with the next “it” product. And it’s not just emotionally driven. Partnering with the next “it” product is an extremely effective and pragmatic marketing strategy. Brands can generate excitement amongst existing customers while simultaneously extending awareness of their brand to the partner’s customers. Some common “it” partner categories over which brands compete include blockbuster movie releases, the latest electronic devices and hot new social media players.

Over the last few months, there’s been growing interest in a new “it” category: cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin has emerged as the Xerox or Kleenex of the category, with newer names such as Ethereum, Ripple and many others gaining notoriety. The digital currency checks several of the “it” criteria boxes: it’s new, garners a lot of press, gets everybody talking, and provides status for those who own it. People who don’t even know what cryptocurrency is—or more specifically, those who don’t fully understand it—still want to own it for the sole purpose of saying they have it. They want to be seen as an early adopter, part of the “it” crowd.

Despite delivering on a number of positive “it” criteria, marketers should proceed with caution before hitching their wagon to this global phenomenon. As with anything truly new, a partnership can be a gamble, and this new category is far from a traditional corporate product launch.

While the benefits may ultimately outweigh the risks, it’s important to understand the potential downside of partnering with cryptocurrencies.

Historically, currency is the most popular prize, reward and premium. It rises to the top of almost every focus group or survey response. Cash is king because everyone uses it; everyone accepts it as payment. Cryptocurrency is in many ways a modern, sexier version of cash. It may be even more appealing than cash to a progressive, image-conscious brand.

However, cryptocurrency falls way short of cash when it comes to universal appeal to consumers or acceptance by retailers. In a recent poll by LendEDU, awareness of Bitcoin is strong, with 78.6 percent of Americans responding that they have heard of it, while awareness for Ethereum (31.6 percent) and Ripple (22.2 percent) is considerably less.

Of course, awareness doesn’t always translate to adoption. Less than 15 percent of Americans responded that they currently own or have owned Bitcoin. And retailers have been even more reluctant to jump on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. According to Morgan Stanley, only 0.6 percent of the top 500 online retailers accept Bitcoin, which actually represents a decline from 1 percent in 2016.

Why are these stats important? Because consumer participation in marketing programs that offer niche prizes and rewards is typically much lower.

Some loyalty providers have started offering cryptocurrency as a reward option, which, in theory, is strategically sound. It’s a digital reward that eliminates the expense of warehousing and fulfillment costs. It’s appealing to international loyalty programs because it’s a global currency. But despite those positives, it carries substantial risk as a reward item.

This extremely volatile currency can see exponential price fluctuations in a relatively short period of time, which could be a death sentence to a loyalty program. If cryptocurrency has a tenfold increase in value, it translates to a tenfold increase in loyalty program currency cost or the need for the loyalty program to perpetually rebalance the points required to redeem the reward, which will frustrate program members.

This is perhaps the most important factor to consider. Whenever a brand creates a partnership, any negative PR associated with its partner casts a shadow over the sponsoring brand. Cryptocurrency is a high-risk partner for a variety of reasons, ranging from huge drops in valuation to regulation scrutiny.

Recent news reports about cryptocurrency, either as a category or about an individual cryptocurrency, often have a negative spin simply to garner more attention. All it takes is one of the cryptocurrencies to take a PR hit, and the rest will suffer.

That’s how “it” category news works: If a brand is running an incentive-based program with cryptocurrency and bad news breaks, that brand’s program suddenly becomes toxic.

Even with all of these concerns, there are still compelling rationales for partnering with cryptocurrency. For the right brand, targeting the right consumers (such as millennials who have greater awareness and acceptance of cryptocurrency), it might be the perfect “it” product. It all comes down to whether the benefits to the brand outweigh the risks. Proceed with any program with an eyes-wide-open understanding of the hazards and a contingency mitigation strategy should the cryptocurrency news cycle turn south."
"McAfee today launches its quarterly McAfee Labs Threats Report revealing the latest trends in cyber threat growth. Since last quarter, the amount of new cyber threats found every second has doubled, with McAfee Labs detecting 478 new cyber threats every minute or 8 every second.

The report takes a detailed look at the latest tactics employed by criminal groups, reporting a clear diversifying of strategy with a move from traditional money makers such as ransomware, to the practice of hijacking Bitcoin and Monero wallets.

Alongside this, the report reveals the extent to which the healthcare sector is under attack. McAfee Labs found a 211% surge in disclosed security incidents against the healthcare industry, with many incidents caused by organisational failure to comply with security best practices or address known vulnerabilities in medical software.

“The 18% rise in security incidents across Europe during Q4 is worrying, but we know not all incidents are reported. This will change when the GDPR comes into force in May, when non-compliance could lead to negative brand impact that could easily be more costly than fines from the regulators. Cited as ‘the most comprehensive privacy regulation globally’, the GDPR will introduce extensive requirements to minimise risk to personal data when it is introduced. Being GDPR compliant requires a combination of knowledge, processes, policies, technology and training, as well as detailed understanding of data flows to and from third parties and cloud services. Cyber threats have never been more of a concern and with cyber criminals often targeting personal data, a “privacy first” IT philosophy is a must.

“Our research reveals a 211% surge in disclosed security incidents against the healthcare industry last quarter. Healthcare organisations are a valuable target for cybercriminals who have set aside ethics in favour of profits, as they hold some very valuable personal data. Many incidents were caused by organisational failure to comply with security best practice or address known vulnerabilities in medical software.

“Given the complex requirements of the GDPR and its governance on where data goes, how it is shared and who can access it, businesses need to be prepared to take a holistic approach to GDPR compliance. Businesses must confidently understand GDPR compliance gaps and implement necessary controls to address them across all cloud services – including services like Office 365, Box, Salesforce and Slack, as well as custom applications running in public infrastructure-as-a-service platforms.”"
"Cryptocurrency-mining software has been discovered on the Apple Mac Store, hiding in a Calendar application with hundreds of thousands of downloads.

Users of the macOS software, developed by a company called Qbix, voiced frustration as their computer speeds tanked after using the program, dubbed ""Calendar 2."" Analysts found the feature had slipped past Apple’s internal security procedures and was designed to mine a cryptocurrency known as Monero.

The crypto-mining option does not appear to have been entirely malicious and was clearly advertised to users as a way to access premium content for no cost.

See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows

However, complaints emerged that the process—advertised as being unobtrusive—was launching without permission, causing CPU usage to spike with no warning. Qbix founder Gregory Magarshak told Ars Technica that the application, now removed from the official Mac App Store, had suffered from two separate security issues that caused it to use more computing power than intended.

Magarshak said: “We have decided to remove the miner in the app. The next version will remove the option to get free features via mining.” He noted that the rollout had “a perfect storm of bugs” and denied wanting to mine crypto without asking.

“Ultimately, even though we technically could have remedied the situation and continued on benefiting from the pretty large income such a miner generates, we took the above as a sign that we should get out of the mining business,” he added.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Qbix said that it is currently working on a software update that will fix the bugs. On its site, it says the app has 757,714 users, but that number contains every person since version one. The company claims that, in total, the application has been used 93 million times.

Some developers are beginning to see cryptocurrency miners as a way to circumvent traditional advertising, letting users trade CPU power for free services. The Pirate Bay file sharing service was met with backlash last year after installing a strain of mining software called 'CoinHive' without visitors’ permission.

The miner in the Calendar 2 software was “xmr-stak”, according to a technical analysis published earlier this week by researcher Patrick Wardle. “Remember when Apple rather strongly implied that Macs don't get viruses?” he wrote.

On an Apple security page, the U.S. tech giant states that its apps “may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies” but only if they are compliant with all state and federal law. It does not provide rules on crypto-mining bundles.

The rise in cryptocurrency mining software coincided with bitcoin’s recent price hike. However, despite alleged links to cybercrime, experts warn the practice is not always dodgy.

“Coin miners are not inherently malicious,” Microsoft’s Windows Defender research team wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. But it went on to add that trojanized miners are now “evolving to become the monetization tool of choice for cybercriminals.” In many cases, a strong anti-virus software will locate a miner before it launches."
"You don’t have to be a seasoned stock market veteran to understand that the price of investments can be volatile. Whether you’re having a spot of or managing a multi-million pound portfolio, you should know and understand the role that risk plays in the markets.

However there’s normal volatility and there’s the sort of capriciousness seen among the cryptocurrency market. The likes of Bitcoin in particular are prone to wild swings – gaining and losing thousands of pounds in the blink of an eye – the sort of thing that has set this asset apart from others, attracting headlines in the media and causing furrowed brows among traders. So, what causes the cryptocurrency market to be like this?

What is a fair price for a cryptocurrency? The chances are that many assets in this market have been over-priced in the last year. But no-one really knows for sure and that makes it difficult for the market to settle on a fair valuation. This isn’t a tangible asset like a commodity or a company with annual accounts to guide the share price – it’s new and yet to be properly understood.

What is fair to say, however, is that there has been plenty of hype about cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoin. This hype has helped to fuel growth – with people keen not to miss out – which, in turn, has fuelled further growth and the creation of a bubble. Many analysts and sceptics have rushed to predict when and where the bubble will burst, with nervousness around this helping to cause price swings.

About 40 per cent of the Bitcoin is held by roughly 1,000 users. These people are, , known as whales and are seen to hold great power. One person, shifting a large amount of Bitcoin at one time can cause a substantial ripple throughout the market. There is a feeling that many whales probably know each other and talk about their investments. Given that this is a digital currency and not a security, experts say there’s not currently anything to stop a group agreeing to buy enough cryptocurrency to push the price up and then cash out within minutes.

Cryptocurrencies have proved a popular investment choice for millennials. It’s easy to see why. They’re new, exciting, digital and there’s a sense that you can make a decent amount of money quickly. Yet attracting a band of novice traders can, in itself, increase the chances of volatility – with amateur investors more likely to panic at slight price movements, partly due to their inexperience and partly because they’re typically less likely to have as much disposable income to risk.

Part of the attraction of cryptocurrencies is that they’re free from the control of central banks and governments – as well as the privacy they offer. These factors are, however, also attractive for people who want to engage in unsavoury practices. Whether it be market manipulators or people selling illegal goods – cryptocurrencies have attracted negative headlines as well as positive ones and this all effects the price. This does look set to change – with governments across the globe looking at ways to rein in cryptocurrencies with regulation (South Korea being a ). While that might clamp down on unsavoury practices, however, these regulations do risk diluting the appeal of cryptocurrencies in the first place – which means that each new batch of rules also causes further price volatility."
"On his HBO show Last Week Tonight, John Oliver has educated viewers on obscure topics like the declining value of pennies and Pennsylvania train sets.

But on Sunday night’s show, he turned his attention to a topic we’ve covered frequently: cryptocurrency.

He talked about everything from the crypto conference which stopped accepting Bitcoin payments because they take too long to the burgeoning Bitcoin music industry (it exists, and it’s amazing).

But one of the most interesting parts of the segment came when he revealed that since Bitcoin is an open-source software, budding miners have created over 1,500 cryptocurrencies.

Oliver rattled off a bunch of currency names without going into much detail, but we were intrigued and did some research on each coin he mentioned.

Here’s a look at 12 cryptocurrencies which are making “ripples” in the market, even if you’ve never heard of them.

Dubbed “the official cryptocurrency of porn and adult entertainment,” Titcoin claims to process transactions in under six minutes. Owners of the currency can pay for adult products and services without incriminating payment histories appearing on their credit cards. Titcoin has actually received several nominations at the XBIZ Awards for adult entertainment.

This currency is intended for supporters of President Donald Trump, though it is not in any way associated with him. TrumpCoin can be dished out to investors and then forwarded to Trump as donations. The website also encourages donors to keep some coins for themselves, however, because Trump wants them to be “better off financially.”

This coin aims to “decentralize Jesus” as “the currency of God’s son.” Unlike other “morally bereft” cryptocurrencies, Jesus Coin offers forgiveness of sins and claims to save all of its owners from hell (as long as they’re Christian). It even hopes to become more valuable than the Christian church by 2050. God bless.

There’s not much information available about this cryptocurrency, but its website lists many possible use cases, including messaging, coding, content distribution and data checking. The coin makers also want to open an “Insane Space” where users can “get those creative juices flowing” and “make the future happen.”

A mobile currency available on both the App Store and Google Play, Electroneum is secure, private and designed for mass adoption. It claims to have access to over 100 million smartphone users, who can mine their first coins minutes after downloading the app. The app’s mobile mining feature went live just last week.

It was developed specifically for the online gaming community, who already collect, buy and sell items in games. Gamers who win WAX tokens in games can exchange them for cryptocurrency. As of this week, more than five million in-game items can be bought and exchanged on WAX.

All digital coins value privacy, but Particl takes it to another level. Billed as a “privacy platform” and “the Swiss Army knife of cryptocurrencies,” the marketplace is anonymously encrypted, and all transactions are untraceable. What’s more, Particl is governed by its community of stakeholders rather than an executive team or third-party group.

Aimed at businesses, this currency will help users find sales leads instantly so they can aim their products at specific groups of people. Snovio also ensures that users have the most up-to-date, relevant data on phone numbers and email addresses. And business owners can pay for these leads in a transparent, decentralized marketplace. Snovio’s proprietary mailing list launches next month, when we’ll find out if this is too good to be true or not.

This system adopts cryptocurrency for the credit card era.

Once users download the Plutus app and get a Plutus debit card, they can use the currency anywhere credit cards are accepted (over 40 million stores in all). Even better, the transactions have zero fees. As a funny Easter egg, the mock credit card on Plutus’ website belongs to Vitalik Buterin, the creator of the Ethereum marketplace.

Each NuBit is sold for $1, so it has the same value as a dollar and can theoretically be used in its place. There are no vendor fees, and coins can be sent anywhere in the world for pennies per transaction. There’s also no cost to download a NuBits wallet—it’s available for Windows, Mac, Android and Linux users.

At first glance, Clams seem like the hippie anarchist cryptocurrency. The website promises a network “freed from tyranny,” and anyone who runs the Clams software on their computer is eligible to create and transfer coins within one minute of first use. This system theoretically ensures “freedom, fairness and equality” so users can “dig for clams” without fear.

Another anonymous, untraceable currency, Deep Onion features special protections so it can’t be hacked or attacked by bad actors or government agencies. Payments can be sent and received worldwide instantly. Plus, its mascot wears a Guy Fawkes mask so you know he’s serious.

Oliver particularly liked this coin.

“I tried to come up with a dumber name than Deep Onion, but it just can’t be done,” he said.

As there are so many different styles of karate, there are many different governing organizations (Such as ITKF, WKF and WFF) overseeing tournaments and rankings. The BoutsPro white paper outlines how bringing all elements together needs a strong fund management system which can generate revenue from multiple sources, for example, sponsorship and advertisements.

The company highlights how the teaching of karate differs from other mainstream sports such as football, where players can get started and develop without the need for direct contact with a coach; karate students need an expert to personally guide them from the beginning, both physically and mentally. So now through the use of Blockchain and cryptocurrency, BoutsPro claims they have found a way to effectively manage these important relationships around the world.

The white paper explains that by implementing Blockchain, it will ‘allow trust management and efficiency on the technological level. This will help to establish the system which can manage the whole system as well as the market requirements.’ They also say that this will be attractive to companies not yet involved in karate, as well as those already invested or involved in sponsorship with the sport. The team of karate ‘legends’ hopes to use cryptocurrency to ‘transform traditional karate to professional karate,’ thus upping the profile of the ancient martial art.

As a result, BoutsPro has launched their own crypto token (BOUTS, type ERC20) based on Ethereum Blockchain technology (1 ETH = 9,000 BOUTS). The ICO began on March 11th (no presale or private sale– the team would like to emphasize that it has a focus on equal opportunity) and will continue until March 25th.

There are extensive ways for holders to utilize their tokens. The centralized portal of BoutsPro will allow users to access lots of karate information relevant to them, such as details on ranking and tournaments, plus access to training tips. Tickets to events can also be purchased online using BOUTS. Private clubs and teams (to participate in the World Professional Karate League) will be franchised and sold on the revenue share module.

Other developments include BoutsPro TV (in partnership with QuickMedia and Pozetta Broadcasters) featuring live streaming and on-demand services for users. They aim to be creating content by later on in 2018. Relating to this are their plans to enter film production. Inspired by the success of martial arts titles such as ‘Karate Kid,’ BoutsPro hope to produce ‘one world class movie based on karate, per year.’  Users can also exchange BOUTS for participation in the dedicated online gaming platform, which aims to ‘provide healthy entertainment and educate basics of karate to the common people as well athletes.’ Finally, BoutsPro is planning to create world-class stadiums and dojos around the world for their members, as well as launching specialized sports insurance for BoutsPro athletes.

"The popularity of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Monero, Bitcoin, and others has led to a surge in coin mining operations that are plaguing the enterprise. According to new Microsoft Windows Defender research, an average of 644,000 PCs per month encountered some form of mining malware between the months of September 2017 and January 2018.

The report simply noted that the computers ""encountered"" the malware, and didn't explicitly say they were infected. However, it does point out that the 644,000 machines were individual, unique computers—giving a startling picture of just how rampant coin mining malware has become.

These forms of malware, also known as cryptominers, are finding their way onto enterprise networks as well. Whether by a malicious attacker, or a rogue employee who wants to make some extra money, they have become a serious problem for enterprise IT.

SEE: Cybersecurity in 2018: A roundup of predictions (Tech Pro Research)

Cryptocurrency and its mining are not malicious by nature, but they are often used in criminal transactions due to their anonymity. Many IT leaders tend to see cryptominers as a simple nuisance, but they should be regarded very carefully as they ""eat up precious computing resources,"" the post said. This can lead to wear and tear on company hardware and cause productivity problems for the workforce.

In fact, Microsoft recently worked to block a cryptomining attack that targeted more than 400,000 machines. Known as Dofoil, or Smoke Loader, it was a trojan that used process hollowing to swap legitimate code with malware.

""We have seen a wide range of malicious cryptocurrency miners, some of them incorporating more sophisticated mechanisms to infect targets, including the use of exploits or self-distributing malware,"" the Microsoft blog said. ""We have also observed that established malware families long associated with certain modus operandi, such as banking trojans, have started to include coin mining routines in recent variants.""

The rise of cryptomining has coincided with a drop in ransomware attacks, the post said, as criminals may be shifting their methods. Additional threats include browser-based cryptocurrency miners through a technique known as cryptojacking and unauthorized use of legitimate coin miners.

IT leaders who want to avoid dealing with legitimate cryptominers on their office network should identify them as ""potentially unwanted applications"" (PUA) so they can be flagged. Trojanized miners, on the other hand, are classified as malware and will be automatically detected and blocked by Microsoft security products, the post said."
"On January 30, social media giant, Facebook updated its ads policy, prohibiting adverts that promote cryptocurrency and ICOs. While many believed that Facebook’s decision is an unforced decision made to eradicate scam ICO schemes, the latest report has emerged, revealing that the FBI actually pressured Facebook to ban crypto-related adverts. Now, the federal authority is trying to force Google to do same.

Facebook’s advertisement policy update that imposed a ban on all crypto-related adverts was not a genuine decision by the company but a result of constant FBI pressure on the social media heavyweight. The same forces that pressurized Facebook into changing its policy are also trying to make Google do same.

A senior investigator at the Manitoba Securities Commision and chairman of Canada’s Binary Options Task Force, Jason Roy, disclosed that:

“What happened is that Canada’s Binary Options Task Force, as well as the FBI, explained to Facebook what the concerns were and that these types of ads are leading to people becoming victims. We’ve been talking to Google and had similar discussions and are waiting for them to take similar action.”

The official noted that it took several months to persuade Facebook to ban crypto ads.

“We’re very pleased,” he said, adding that, “My hope is that Google will enact a similar policy, where they specifically name products like binary options, ICOs, and cryptocurrencies.”

Roy and the FBI have been making consistent efforts to make Google follow the paths of Facebook, but Google is not ready to play such dirty games. “We already ban and enforce against misleading ads and misrepresentation (across all categories),” a Google representative said.

These security watchdogs do not seem to understand the fact that there are thousands of legit ICOs and cryptocurrencies out there. Explaining the reason why they think banning crypto ads by Google was the best thing to do to curb ICO scams, Roy said:

There is still a whole lot of confusion as regards the classification of blockchain cryptocurrencies and tokens.

While the SEC believes that all tokens are securities, and must, therefore, get registered under it, the Wyoming state legislature does not share same views with the SEC and has clearly stated that digital tokens are not securities.

The cryptocurrency industry is worth nearly $370 billion (at press time), with over 1,500 altcoins and digital tokens. It is a fact that the industry is still largely unregulated, but pressuring social media platforms and online search engines to function as law enforcement agencies is surely not a way to regulate this industry in its nascent stages."

"The key to making cryptocurrencies real lies in having real things to buy with them, as opposed to crypto-things.

Bitcoin is a crypto-thing. It’s an encryption key. It doesn’t exist. While it is illustrated in the form of a coin, it isn’t a coin. It’s magnetic ink. It can easily disappear.

Initial coin offerings (ICOs) aren’t real things either. They’re crypto-stock. They’re a bet, usually a bad one, that someone will fulfill a pie-crust promise they make to build a business out of your cryptocurrency and make money for you.

The progress of cryptocurrency in helping you buy real goods and services should be a key story for 2018.

So far that progress can best be described as iffy.

Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: ) made a fortune on the California gold rush by following the money. Chainalysis hopes to get rich tracking the cryptocurrency boom. Its pitch is that it’s anti-money-laundering software. The Internal Revenue Service has contracted with it to track bitcoin transactions for tax purposes. The company has contracts with a total of six federal agencies.

Along the way they’ve learned that $20 billion in bitcoin has simply disappeared, lost to the blockchain, that criminal gangs are now targeting cryptocurrency holders (and their families) for kidnapping, and that serious criminals are abandoning bitcoin for such coins as Monero, which promise greater anonymity.

When looking at what you can buy with cryptocurrency, it’s important to reiterate that the market is far more advanced in Asia than the U.S., because the big savings come from it being a global store of value. Koreans with crypto don’t have to buy yuan to buy from China if they can use cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency ATMs are already a thing, but their primary opportunity lies in developing countries without stable currencies and among people who already use many currencies. Moving among “fiat” currencies like the yuan and yen always means going from a bid price to an ask. Currency exchange services aren’t cheap. But an Ether is an Ether the whole world around.

As to physical goods you can buy with bitcoin, media stories about it are slightly misleading. Most of these goods are outside the U.S., like Dubai real estate or college degrees in Cyprus. A small number of high-end merchants, like some Las Vegas casino hotels, are starting to take it, but these are individual deals with individual merchants. Cryptocurrency is not yet the same as cash in the U.S.

In Korea, where 14% of working people have experience with cryptocurrency, you can now use it for travel.

The recent volatility in Ripple, which was designed to trade at $1 per coin but has gone from $1.08 to 84 cents in just four trading days this week, came just after a South Korean bank announced it would stage a trial of international remittances using it.

The main real thing you can buy and sell with cryptocurrency is money.

If prices achieve stability — and Ripple is designed for just that — you could find it used heavily in international trade, because its value crosses borders intact.

But making that happen requires something like law and order. So long as it’s the medium of choice for violating international sanctions and for criminal finance, it’s hard to see peace breaking out between cryptocurrency and the nation-state.

"Goldman Sachs’ team of technical analysis which is led by Sheba Jafari was involved in making yet another prediction of Bitcoin (BTC). Therefore, they stated that there are various risks on the cryptocurrency where it might sink below the February low. This is according to a report on March 12 by the business insider.

On 11th February which was on Sunday, the team was involved in drafting and sending notes to their clients in warning that during the next sell-off of Bitcoin, the price might fall significantly below the February low which was $5,922. Therefore, the Jafari team made suggestions that the next sell-off might be initiated by breaking of the short terms support which is at the $9,210 level.

According to Jafari, the break is termed as significant due to the fact that it implies the potential for more decline. Therefore, her team warned people and told them to watch the Bitcoin price. They further predicted that the next meaningful level would be at the $7,668 and $7,198 level.

Jafari is the head of technical strategy in Goldman Sachs and has been known for a long time for her Bitcoin criticisms. Last year in July, Jafari made predictions that Bitcoin would drop and hit the $4,000 price level. Contrary to her statement and predictions, Bitcoin hit the $7,000 mark. After this happened, she later said that Bitcoin would consolidate at the $8,000 mark before it could be subjected to further increase.

Bitcoin increased in rice at the time and hit the $20,000 mark in Dec 2017. This was a significant improvement from the lowest point during the years start at $1,000. This was before it sank to the $6,048 level on February 6, 2018. Most of the experts, however, believe that the current fall was due to the $400 million sell-off by the bankruptcy trustee and attorney of Mt Gox. This was the largest global Bitcoin exchange."

"“Cryptojacking” has become a major security threat for PC users around the world.

The term refers to malicious software or scripts which secretly use your device’s resources to mine cryptocurrency.

These programs use your CPU or GPU to mine cryptocurrency and send it to an attacker’s wallet address, usually resulting in performance decreases on the victim’s machine.

Embedded cryptocurrency mining scripts in webpages could be a legitimate income source if visitors are consulted and notified of the script, but many perform this operation without the visitor’s consent.

Malware which runs cryptocurrency mining software is more malicious, as it aims to constantly drain a victim’s PC’s performance – even when no other programs are open.

Fortunately, there are several ways to combat cryptojacking scripts in webpages and malware.

If you visit a webpage and notice that your device is running slowly, open your task manager and check if your browser is consuming unusually high amounts of CPU or GPU processing power.

These hidden scripts use your device’s physical resources to mine cryptocurrency, and the effects of the programs are therefore relatively easy to spot.

You can also search the page’s HTML information for any references to “Coinhive” or other cryptojacking scripts.

To protect yourself from these scripts, you can install browser extensions which detect and block cryptojacking scripts on all websites.

These vary depending on the browser you use, but several popular add-ons are already being used globally.

Please note that using browser extensions carry their own risks, and they could block other elements on certain webpages.

Two popular anti-cryptojacking extensions, available on Chrome and Firefox, are:

It should also be noted that certain browsers like Opera have built-in cryptojacking protection software.

The installation of malicious cryptojacking software is more difficult to accomplish than the browser-based script scam, but has been a problem for a longer time.

If you have an effective anti-malware suite installed, you should be adequately protected against the most common cryptojacking malware.

However, if you are commonly downloading files from unverified sources and do not have additional protection, installing software such as Malwarebytes will help you combat cryptojacking malware.

Malwarebytes has also started blocking browser-based cryptocurrency miners, allowing users to install it as a catch-all solution.

In a statement regarding cryptojacking scripts, Malwarebytes said it does not regard the scripts as intrinsically malicious – but condemns their execution when user permission is not requested.

“The reason we block Coinhive is because there are site owners who do not ask for their users’ permission to start running CPU-gorging applications on their systems,” said Malwarebytes."
"The crypto market is down right now and many investors, especially those who came in late are confused as to what direction the market will go. On one hand, you have YouTube videos telling you how coin X or Y is poised for takeoff, then there are sections of the mainstream media pushing the idea that crypto is dead. While it is easy to ignore some random YouTuber trying to explain to you why a coin will go up, it is difficult not to feel jittery when the mainstream media puts doubts in your mind. Take the recent analysis of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies by John Oliver, on his last week show that runs on HBO.

In the said episode, Oliver discredits blockchain and cryptocurrencies by presenting those investing in this space as either unaware of what blockchain is all about, or are just foolish enough to chase after the allure of easy money where there is none. He uses companies like Bitconnect to drive his point home, on why cryptocurrency is not worth it. To an undecided investor still reeling from the recent market downturn, it is easy to believe him.

But is his critique of cryptocurrencies disguised as humor really true? Absolutely not!  Take for example the part where he argues that the reason why major corporations such as IBM and Walmart have not adopted blockchain despite it being secure is that no one understands what it is about. That argument is wrong and misleading. The truth is that there are many companies out there that are experimenting with blockchain technology.

Take Starbucks for example. The company announced that it would be adding a cryptocurrency to its payment systems soon. Microsoft, one of the largest cryptocurrencies is already working with five blockchain platforms. Even in the social media space, companies like Steam are prove enough that blockchain based solutions are working. Blockchain technology has also been used to successful run an election in Sierra Leone, where it has acted as a stabilizing factor by instilling trust in the electoral process. The list is endless.

Oliver also uses a company like Bitconnect as prove that the whole crypto thing is a hype, a passing fad that won’t last. But is that really the truth? That’s like saying that Madoff’s schemes were prove that the stock market is a sham. The truth is that every industry has some bad apples that have no bearing at all, to the future growth of their respective industries.

What, therefore, can one learn from this episode of Oliver’s show? The most important lesson you should carry with you is that you should take your time to study and understand the crypto market. There are so many parties who feel threatened by blockchain technology, and would do anything to see the technology go down. Just to give you context, the polish central bank recently admitted to spreading FUD against cryptocurrencies.  That’s why it’s a wise move to do your own research. The tech may take time before it is mass adopted but once it does, those who were brave enough to hold will reap big.

This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrencies or a recommendation to invest. Historic performance is no guarantee of future returns. As an investment class, cryptocurrencies are speculative investments and investing in cryptocurrencies involves significant risks – they are highly volatile, vulnerable to hacking and capital loss and sensitive to secondary activity. Before investing you should obtain advice and decide whether the potential return outweighs the risks."

"After stopping an attempt to steal cryptocurrency, a Binance bounty is being offered for information on the threat actor behind the failed theft.

The large scale attack occurred on March 7 and was blocked within two minutes, according to the company. But Binance said it doesn't want to ""simply play defense"" and wants to be more proactive in preventing cryptocurrency theft.

""Even though the hacking attempt against Binance on March 7th was not successful, it was clear it was a large-scale, organized effort. This needs to be addressed,"" Binance wrote in a blog post. ""Binance is offering a $250,000 USD equivalent bounty to anyone who supplies information that leads to the legal arrest of the hackers involved in the attempted hacking incident on Binance on March 7th, 2018.""

The Binance attack on March 7 was not the first attempt either. The company said the threat actors gathered user credentials via a phishing campaign which began in early Jan. 2018 and ramped up in mid-February. Using those credentials, the hackers triggered a large amount of transactions in an attempt to steal Bitcoin from Binance users via fraudulent trades. The exchange's ""automatic risk management system was triggered,"" stopping the trades and effectively ending the Binance attack.

It's unclear why the Binance bounty has been offered publicly rather than commissioning a cybersecurity vendor to investigate the incident and attribute the attack. It's also unclear how many Binance users were affected by the phishing attack. Binance did not respond to requests for comment.

The company promised that ""the first person to supply substantial information and evidence that leads to the legal arrest of the hackers, in any jurisdiction"" will earn the Binance bounty of $250,000 worth of the exchange's proprietary Binance coin, based on the exchange rate at the time of the transfer. This means the value of the Binance bounty can fluctuate, if the receiver doesn't cash out right away.

Additionally, the company said it will create a fund of $10,000,000 to pay similar bounties in the event of a future Binance attack. Collecting the Binance bounty could be challenging because it requires a ""legal arrest"" of the threat actors and not just identification or indictments. Recently, while there have been high profile arrests, like NSA contractor Hal Martin, who stole classified materials and cyberweapons over the course of 20 years, threat actors such as those behind the Yahoo data breach were indicted and not arrested.

The attempted attack on Binance is the latest in a trend of cryptocurrency-related malicious activity. Threat actors have been increasingly targeting cryptocurrency exchanges with cyberattacks, including the theft of nearly $80,000,000 in Bitcoin. Additionally, there has been a growing trend of cryptojacking attacks in which malicious code is implanted on a target system to skim processing power for mining cryptocurrency."

"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has claimed Bitcoin is the Napster of cryptocurrencies. He says cryptos are solving real-world money remittance and banking problems. Adding future generations are set to keep improving the ability to make payments, especially across borders.

The CEO is quick to compare BTC with the peer-to-peer file-sharing platform, Napster, a music sharing platform that was revolutionary at the time but failed to make any lasting impression.

The CEO is set to participate in the Millennium 2020 conference that will be held in Singapore, he said:

“Some may look back at Bitcoin and say that it is the Napster of digital assets. What I mean by that is that Napster was the first to digitize music and demonstrate that you can do a lot of cool things with that. But ultimately they were circumventing trademark laws, they were circumventing royalty payments and the government stepped in and Napster wasn’t successful. But Spotify, iTunes, and Pandora were successful.”

“I think what you will find is that maybe the next generation of digital assets will end up solving some of the problems that Bitcoin set out to solve.”

The statement can easily be seen as a way of promoting Ripple as he puts down Bitcoin. Ripple is a cryptocurrency that claims to decentralized whose goal is to help traditional financial institutions settle domestic and cross-border payments.

In many ways, Bitcoin is like Napster as it tries to undermine traditionally regulated infrastructures. For now, though, it’s too early to dismiss the dominant cryptocurrency. Assuming the coin will go the way of the file-sharing platform is far to fetched for now.

Bitcoin is the Napster of cryptos according to the Ripple CEO and his comments are intended to encourage investment in Ripple against doing so in the top crypto coin.

In the comment section below let us know if you agree with these comments from the Ripple CEO."

"WASHINGTON - Governments and central banks need to collaborate on developing regulations for crypto-assets to prevent them from becoming a new vehicle for money laundering and terrorist financing, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday.

In a blog posting ahead of a meeting of Group of 20 finance leaders next week, Lagarde said the technology behind cryptocurrencies, including blockchain, offer exciting advancements that could power financial inclusion. New, low-cost payment methods could empower millions of people in low-income countries who lack traditional bank accounts.

""Before we get there, however, we should take a step back and understand the peril that comes along with the promise,"" Lagarde said, adding that their appeal also makes them dangerous.

""These digital offerings are typically built in a decentralized way and without the need for a central bank. This gives crypto-asset transactions an element of anonymity, much like cash transactions,"" she said. ""The result is a potentially major new vehicle for money laundering and the financing of terrorism.""

Before the July 2017 shutdown of dark web marketplace AlphaBay, some US$1 billion worth of illegal drugs, hacking tools, firearms and toxic chemicals were sold through crypto-assets on the exchange, she said.

Some early efforts are encouraging, including those led by the Financial Stability Board to study fintech advancements and by the Financial Action Task Force to provide guidance on electronic money laundering.

She said the IMF was focused on encouraging countries to develop policies that ensure financial integrity and protect consumers in crypto-assets in much the same manner as it has done for the traditional financial sector.

She also said technology behind crypto assets can be used to ""fight fire with fire,"" including distributed ledger technology that speed up information sharing between market participants and regulators. This can be used to create registries of standard, verified customer information and help fight cross-border tax evasion, she said.

Regulators can also use biometrics, artificial intelligence and cryptography to enhance digital security and identify suspicious transactions ""in close to real time,"" Lagarde added.

Applying the same securities rules to crypto assets as standard securities also can help increase transparency and alert buyers to potential risks.

""To be truly effective, all these efforts require close international cooperation. Since crypto-assets know no borders, the framework to regulate them must be global as well,"" Lagarde said.

The G20 major economies will explore regulation of crypto-assets this year, including at a meeting next week in Buenos Aires for G20 finance ministers and central bank governors."

"Shares of Goldcliff Resource Corporation (CVE:GCN) last traded at 0.165, representing a move of 3.125%, or 0.005 per share, on volume of 2,000 shares. After opening the trading day at 0.165, shares of Goldcliff Resource Corporation traded in a close range. Goldcliff Resource Corporation currently has a total float of 19.84 million shares and on average sees 102,228 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 0.11 and high of 0.52.

S&P/TSX is Canada’s leading market index that features stocks of the largest companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The index features stocks as measured by market-capitalization, and currently account for 70% of the total market capitalization of the TSX.

The S&P TSX came into being after replacing the TSE 300 Index that was initially used as a benchmark for the country’s stock market. The performance of the index is most of the time used by investors worldwide to gauge the health of the country’s equity market as well as overall economy.

Inclusion into the index requires a company to have its stock first listed on the TSX. The company must also be incorporated under Canadian laws. Given that the index is market-capitalization weighted, all stocks listed must weigh at least 0.05% of the index with a share price tag of not less than C$1 in the last three trading session of any given month. Goldcliff Resource Corporation complies with the rules for listing.

The index also plays close watch to a company’s liquidity prior to the listing of its stock. For a stock to be listed on the S&P TSX it must be liquid enough to support unusual volume changes as well as dollar movements. The measure also ensures that at no one point one stock dominates the movement of the entire index.

The S&P TSX has about 250 components at any given point from which the weighted points are generated. These components cover a variety of sectors ranging from Materials, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Energy to Healthcare. Currently, Financials account for 36% of the index total market capitalization with the Energy sector coming a close second with 20% share.

Since its inception, the S&P TSX has registered an all-time low of 217.50 points registered in February 1950. The Index all time high currently stands at 15657.63 points, printed in September 2014. The energy and the commodities sectors are known to have a huge say on the index overall performance given that a majority of components it carries have exposure to the two sectors.

S&P TSX is dominated by commodity stocks notably in the oil sector given the concentration of natural resources in Canada. The index was on the receiving end at the beginning of the year having taken a beating on oil prices plunging to multi-year lows. A recovery in the sector in recent months has aroused hopes of a bright future as commodity prices continue to strengthen.

A move by OPEC members to curb production should have a positive impact on the S&P TSX given that the same would bolster stock prices of a good number of stocks it carries. Stability in the Canadian economy is another reason the index continues to evoke interest from institutional investors worldwide as it is seen as a safe haven compared to other economies that are slowly sinking into recession. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect Goldcliff Resource Corporation.

Domestic and foreign retail investors flocking into the Canadian equity market is only expected to push the S&P TSX higher given the growth prospects of most of the companies it carries.

"While these past couple of days have not been good for any cryptocurrency, Tron (TRX) has taken the recent market crash harder than most. Tron (TRX) lost a large chunk of its value, but things are expected to go back to normal since the developers who are in charge of Tron (TRX) are getting ready to release their own Test Net.

One of the most impressive things about Tron (TRX) is that despite its rather short time of being launched, it already managed to gather a large number of partnerships. Initially, Tron (TRX) was hosted on Ethereum’s platform but this is going to change at the end of March because Tron (TRX) will launch its own blockchain platform.

Tron (TRX)’s developers announced that their own Test Net is going to be officially launched on March 31st and that the TRX token will only exist on that platform. This is a big step ahead in Tron (TRX)’s evolution since it means that it doesn’t rely on Ethereum’s blockchain platform anymore.

Also, the addition of Tron (TRX)’s own Test Net means that there is a lot of room to grow and more importantly, the blockchain platform will attract additional investors. Seeing these positive news one would expect Tron (TRX)’s price to up, but the exact opposite is happening.

Despite being surrounded by positive news, Tron (TRX) lost 5.76% of its total value during the last 24 hours according to Coinmarketcap. Therefore, the TRX token is now priced at $0.035008 and the total market capitalization is valued at $2,301,739,021.

Even though Tron (TRX) might not look like a great cryptocurrency to invest in after checking out the price, the upcoming blockchain platform might affect the price in a positive way. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency market is impossible to predict and Tron (TRX) could always lose even more of its value."
"Cointed is building a network of Bitcoin ATMs in hopes of persuading ordinary folk to buy cryptocurrencies.

Stroll into the lobby of Vienna’s hip Hotel Schani and you’ll find something unusual: an ATM for buying Bitcoin. The touchscreen reveals the current exchange rate, updated every minute. For a brief moment, you could buy 1 Bitcoin at €7,426.44 (around $9100), though many only acquire fractions of a coin.

The machine belongs to Cointed, an Austrian startup now headquartered in Hong Kong. Unlike its competitors such as Bitpanda, Coinfinity and Kurant, Cointed is dipping its fingers into all areas of the cryptocurrency business, from mining and trading to sales and ATMs, which function less like typical bank ATMs and more like Bitcoin vending machines. The company operates 123 cryptocurrency ATMs in Austria and Eastern Europe – almost half of the rapidly increasing total in Europe, according to bitcoinatmmap.com. At one of its machines, Cointed’s customers can buy Bitcoin and other lesser-known cryptocurrencies including Monero, Litecoin, Ether, and Dash.

The machines eliminate the hassles of online trading platforms and for transactions under €500, Cointed has no identification requirements, upholding a key tenet of early cryptocurrencies: anonymity.

Users generally can’t exchange Bitcoin for cash but they can trade cash for Bitcoin and, within minutes of payment, Bitcoins can be transferred to the user’s smartphone – similar online transactions can take minutes and even hours. The company claims it has 30,000 registered customers with 90,000 transactions every month. Last year, it had sales of €150 million."
